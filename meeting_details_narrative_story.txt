    The discussion covered We are writing to you in order to request a hearing to discuss the issue of health alerts and their impact on pharmaceutical dispensing and inspections. We consider it important to address this issue in order to take action and solve any potential problems that may arise. We would appreciate it if you would inform us of your availability to meet and discuss this matter.TOPICS ADDRESSED IN THE MEETING:They request that a representative of the Ministry be present at the meetings they hold with the ISP.On January 9th they have a meeting with the ISP and have had difficulties with the issue of shifts. They report that there is a bill for independent community pharmacies in which they would not participate in the shifts. Pharmacies cannot carry them out for various reasons.There are decisions taken jointly with the ISP that have not been complied with. For example, when the QF is not present during an inspection for justified reasons and arrives at the time of the inspection, the establishment is still prohibited from operating. Another concern as a union is the attitude of the ISP in the inspections lately. They are in a kind of persecution. Whether or not there is a pharmacist in the premises, sometimes they only inspect the presence of the QF, and they do not inspect other areas. The above does not occur in the regions. They do not apply criteria when for justified reasons they must be absent from the premises, which is allowed by the regulations, and they proceed to close it in the same way. They are asked to formally send through a letter what is indicated with respect to the problem that they point out regarding the different criteria used in the inspections carried out by the ISP in the presence of QF in pharmacies. Regarding the presence of a MINSAL representative in the meetings that they hold with the ISP, they are told that they must request it directly from said institution., and the meeting spanned 0 hours, 30 minutes.

As a ministerial policy, there are no fragmented networks for specific populations, because it has negative effects.

    The discussion covered Submit a proposal for collaboration on industrial property.TOPICS ADDRESSED AT THE MEETING:CIF presents the case of a tender for the drug tofacitinib, which was awarded to a laboratory that does not hold the patent for the molecular molecule.The patent holder filed a lawsuit in civil court and requested a prejudicial protection measure for the act and contract. Which was granted by the court.Due to the prejudicial measure, once the tender has been awarded, a contract cannot be concluded.CIF states that the general situation is that a supplier enters the tender knowing that there is a patent holder for a different molecule. In order to have two courses of action available, which are to sign the tender contract and continue the civil process for patent compensation. CIF states that the technical evaluation carried out by MINSAL was not favorable, due to the fact that there is a pending litigation. CIF indicates that this situation would be a problem for CENABAST because it is necessary to move forward with the celebration of the contract for the supply of the network. The ministry is committed to gathering information regarding intellectual property and indicates that currently the patent is not associated with the DCI of the medicines. However, in the draft law of drugs II, laboratories that have a patent will have to associate the patent of the molecule with the DCI in a mandatory manner. CIF requests that CENABAST incorporate a disclaimer in the tender bases, which foresees the situation regarding the intellectual property of the molecules. In addition, they request that the criteria of technical evaluations prepared by the ministry not incorporate elements such as judicial ones., and the meeting spanned 0 hours, 30 minutes.

    The discussion covered We would like to address the current way in which medical samples are dispensed and propose an alternative solution that we wish to implement as YAPP using technology in order to have better control and traceability of this element that directly benefits patients.TOPICS ADDRESSED IN THE MEETING:Yapp has been a health technology company for 6 years, whose goal is to make the pharmaceutical market transparent. For example, they are working with technology so that any pharmacy in Chile can access complementary insurance that is currently exclusive to chain pharmacies. Specifically, in this Lobby, they want to present an opportunity for improvements in matters of medical samples, mainly regarding their storage and traceability. They want to digitize the medical samples so that instead of the doctor personally delivering them to the patient, the patient gives them a coupon, with that coupon the patient requests the medical samples indicated by the doctor and the company sends them to the patient. There would be transparency of the doctors who deliver them, traceability to the patients and avoiding medical samples ending up at fairs and safeguarding their correct storage at all times. The company requests the possibility of carrying out a pilot with laboratories to implement a delivery of medical samples to the patient's home, where the norm is respected. Yapp undertakes to present the results, regarding the number of samples delivered, number of doctors delivering medical samples. This pilot would last no less than 6 months and no more than 12 months. The MINSAL informs you that the current regulations, specifically DS N°3/2010, clearly establishes that medical samples cannot be distributed free of charge anywhere, by any means, under any pretext or condition, that they must be delivered exclusively to professionals authorized to prescribe and these must be dispensed directly by professionals to patients. In accordance with the above, the pilot would be in breach of current regulations, so it should not be carried out. In addition, it is recalled that the Drug Law II, which is being reviewed by this Ministry for its continued processing, brings a series of modifications to medical visits and prescription that could have important effects on medical samples., and the meeting spanned 0 hours, 30 minutes.

Pierinna Gallardo reports that: - It is reported that initially the update of all decrees associated with the practice of health assistants was paused considering the Draft Law that Modifies Book V of the Health Code, currently in the first procedure in the Honorable Chamber of Deputies. Since this project recognizes health technicians in general, it will require that all decrees for assistants be updated, so updating these decrees before this bill is published in the official journal would force us to update again with everything that this implies. - It is reported that the Bill that "Modifies the Health Code, to regulate the practice of surgeries and procedures for aesthetic purposes" is currently in the second stage in the Honorable Chamber of Deputies. It is clarified that this bill seeks to modify article 124 of the health code, the current article from which the regulation of establishments that carry out activities aimed at body care and aesthetic beautification is based. The proposed modification includes non-invasive services, which is why it maintains the regulation of cosmetology offices. - It is said that health professionals, considering that they have more training time than assistants, can assume their functions; however, the Seremis of Health verify that said health professionals have the specific competencies regarding the procedures they perform. Furthermore, this is an opinion that the Comptroller General of the Republic has made on several occasions and in different cases of professionals, technicians and assistants. - Finally, it is mentioned that they can be part of the working table; however, it is important to consider that those who participate in these tables are scientific societies, since their participation is to provide technical information to the coordinating team. In the development of the regulation, a Technical Report is made that considers information from scientific evidence and evidence from the regulation of other countries. In addition, consider that those who participate in this table are made to sign a declaration of conflicts of interest and a declaration of confidentiality; if a participant has conflicts of interest, he will be limited in the voting of the activity directly linked to said conflict., and the meeting spanned 0 hours, 35 minutes.

    The discussion covered Dear Sirs,We would like to request a meeting to present the reasons that, in our opinion, make it necessary to modify the second article of Exempt Decree No. 60, of 2022, of the Ministry of Health, which modified the list of active ingredients classified as "non-new (mature) with long experience of use" contained in Exempt Decree No. 27, of 2012, of the Ministry of Health, adding other "active ingredients or associations". This standard establishes "Diosmin/Hesperidin" as one of these active ingredients. The background information that we will present, mainly related to the bioequivalence studies developed by Laboratorios Raffo SA, will demonstrate the problems posed by maintaining the aforementioned active ingredient as mature. We consider it essential to be able to explain this point, for reasons of public health. We look forward to your response. Kind regards, TOPICS ADDRESSED AT THE MEETING: They report that they have carried out in vivo studies for their Diosmin/Hisperidin products and they hope that said association will be removed from the category of products that demonstrate their TCE as “mature, non-new” products; this is due to the fact that they estimate that the conditions for access to reference products and the availability of methodologies to carry out the respective studies and adequate supply exist; all of which conditions no longer make it worthwhile to maintain the association in the aforementioned category and a change in the matter is plausible. In the same context, they report that their request will be formalized in writing to the Minsal, during the next few days.

Information on the type of use and consumption authorization procedure carried out for each application entered (direct procedure, procedure with inspection without sampling, or procedure with inspection and sampling). 2) In the case of procedures with inspection with sampling, know what analysis is performed and how it is verified that the fortifications of wheat flour comply with Chilean regulations. 3) Importance of knowing the results of the procedures carried out and the results of the requests for authorization for use and disposal. Topics discussed: They ask about the response to the transparency they requested due to measures adopted by the SEREMI Araucanía regarding the health risk of Argentine wheat flour rejected due to the presence of mycotoxins. They raise concerns about the entry into force of the Decree on fortification with VIT. D. They state that they have not been invited to the discussion of the surveillance and communication plan.

    The discussion covered Dear Mr. Daniel Cornejo. I am requesting a meeting for the following reason: About 5 months ago, COMPIN rejected my leave for which I had to present the required documentation (medical report, exams, and others) in which I was also forced to begin my retirement process due to having been on medical leave for a considerable amount of time. I attached everything required, up to the start of my pension. Today, they rejected my medical leave again. On December 7th I received an email from Caja los Andes communicating what was written above. I went to the COMPIN page and it says that the medical commission is still in the evaluation process. I waited a couple of days, but this has not changed. I have called the COMPIN call center twice, to which they tell me that I must attach a medical report that states an estimate of recovery time, exams, and an epicrisis or post-operative report? If I am in the process of medical evaluation, which I started on December 11 with Dr. Jhon Montealegre, I find it unusual to see a report that states recovery, because at this moment I will begin to be evaluated by the medical commission and it can be said that I am in their hands. To continue, on the COMPIN website, as of December 19, my rejected license still does not appear, so I can upload the same information from 4 months ago, because the Rheumatologist has a report from that date and I am not going to go around asking for reports every now and then, in addition to the fact that she states on the license that I am in the process of evaluation for a pension. To all this last, in the call center they tell me that the doctor has 60 days to see my license and decide whether to approve or reject it. And in the meantime, I suppose that they will also pay him his salary in 60 days? I live only on what is paid to me in medical leave since my pathology has not allowed me to return to work, I have ankylosing spondylitis and a positive HLA B27 test, all this treatment is very expensive, just the pharmacy remedies cost me more than $300,000, without counting the tests that I have to take, my debts due to the same have already exceeded all limits; and they casually tell me that I must wait 60 days. Days that for this disease without the necessary remedies is collapse, and horrible pain crises, not to mention that life goes on and there is a life to sustain. I hope that these humble words can make this health system not so cold and numerical, the health of a patient is not just another number, it is another life that he or she did not choose to live this way. Sincerely, Paola Carrasco. THE CASE IS BEING REVIEWED AND GUIDANCE IS BEING PROVIDED ON THE MANAGEMENT OF YOUR MEDICAL LICENSES., and the meeting spanned 1 hours, 0 minutes.

The request is that because they have a population with visual disabilities and with dermatological needs, they request that albinism be included as GES, in order to be able to provide sunscreen as a medicine.

    The discussion covered It is the responsibility of the Head of the Healthcare Network Management Division, through the integrated clinical process management department, to coordinate the activities of the Focal Dystonia Program Specialist Physician Advisory Working Group. This is in accordance with the express provision of Exempt Resolution 674 of 2018 of the Undersecretariat of Healthcare Networks. In this dynamic, it is your division that can coordinate before said advisory working group, the possibility of presenting new publications, accrediting the use, experience and efficacy of products. You cannot just say "The group of specialist physicians is not a passive subject so I do not give them an audience" when it is precisely your Division that must coordinate what I am requesting. The fact that the advisory working group can learn about other scientific publications and accredit their experience with other toxins, different from those they know, will be very useful for the sake of transparency, avoiding acts of corruption and improving treatments in patients, and saving resources for the Treasury. That is why I insist on requesting an audience. I am not asking the Advisory Group directly, for which there are no means of contact, telephone numbers, emails, and it is not known when they meet, or where they meet. That is why it would also be convenient to add them as passive subjects of the Lobby Law, because I also understand that they are paid and make important decisions that affect the botulinum toxins market., and the meeting spanned 1 hours, 0 minutes.

    The discussion covered We are working as a company in conjunction with the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile (Dr. Nibaldo Inestrosa) and SQM on the development of a food supplement that contains vitamins, minerals and a very low concentration of lithium carbonate so that it can contribute to the mental health of the population. - There is sufficient scientific evidence to indicate that consuming lithium carbonate in low concentrations is an excellent neuroprotection. Nordic countries add it to drinking water at times when suicide rates in the population increase. - This food supplement can be added to the production process during food processing. We are looking to market this product as a food supplement, NOT as a medicine, since working with low concentrations does not require medical supervision. For example: a person would have to consume 300 liters of milk/day to consume 300 mg of lithium carbonate or eat 30 kg of bread a day, among others. What makes such food consumption impossible.- There is scientific evidence that indicates that depending on the cultivation area, a food may have lithium carbonate in its nutritional composition, this low concentration has been studied in several countries, including our country, showing that the Aymara people in the north of our country consume llama meat and vegetables that contain lithium carbonate naturally and this would be a protective factor for diseases such as Alzheimer's, depression and bipolarity.- The concentration we are using is very low compared to a lithium carbonate medicine, that is why we request to include it as a food (ingredient) respecting the concentration of use that we have studied.- We seek to be pioneers in the use of lithium carbonate for food use, since our country has increased mental health illnesses and furthermore, we are one of the countries that has lithium carbonate as a natural reserve., and the meeting spanned 1 hours, 0 minutes.

    The discussion covered English: Request: Radio Diferencia NGO, founded under the auspices of the Salvador Psychiatric Hospital in Valparaiso in 2005, widely known nationally and internationally for its work benefiting people with mental disabilities in the community in terms of psychoeducation in mental health and defense of the human rights of people who use mental health services in the region and the country, we were expelled from our headquarters within the designated hospital and had to remove our things from one day to the next. While moving our radio equipment, two employees of the establishment stole a valuable computer from us. Above all, we cannot return to our headquarters, which we have occupied for 18 years, because employees of the workers' unions occupy that space now, that is, here in the hospital. Workers' unions and health professionals have more rights and importance than us, mental health users, who, with effort, without financial resources and through our altruistic voluntary management, are now outside the public mental health system. And in order to continue existing as an institution in the community, we met thanks to the willingness and good will of the La Matriz Corporation and the parish priest who have welcomed us for a year and a half in the parish headquarters of the La Matriz Church in the Puerto de Valparaíso neighborhood, who have offered us their facilities and the recording studios of the aforementioned Corporation to meet to record our radio programs that are broadcast on local stations in the region and on our website www.laradiodiferencia.cl This situation that we are currently experiencing goes against the public policies of the Minsal that have to do with the citizen participation of mental health users and then we do not understand why we have been expelled from the Salvador de Valparaíso Psychiatric Hospital because the authorities of the hospital management and the Valparaíso San Antonio Health Service have told us that we have no place in the hospital in their plans that they are currently implementing in the hospital premises. Lobby: Due to the pandemic, the hospital space could not be occupied, when the activities were resumed they were in the The hospital chapel, but the Electroconvulsive Therapy event came up and they issued a statement because the technical standards were not respected. After that, the hospital management denied the possibility of continuing to meet in the chapel. But during the second semester nothing was done and artistic events continued to be held. They met with the directors of the Health Service. In those meetings they said they could not return. They feel that unions have more rights than people with mental disabilities. Today they are in the La Matriz Parish. They want to participate as users in the Local Development Council. From the Undersecretary of Public Health, it will be done following what was requested: that Radio Diferencia have a space where it can operate and monitor the instances of participation in the Local Development Council. Eduardo Artiga, coordinator of the Mental Health Unit of DIGERA, points out that the Salvador Hospital is undergoing changes in its infrastructure. There is the possibility of looking for another space and he proposed to meet again with the Health Service and see if it is possible that they can operate in the COSAM Domingo Asún, which may be relevant even with the community mental health care model. The pain is that this space of the Radio was replaced by the operation of a union., and the meeting spanned 0 hours, 30 minutes.

    The discussion covered would like to present, after contacting the Presidency of the Republic and being instructed to approach the MINSAL Cabinet and the Undersecretariat of Healthcare Networks, a mental health project tested in a commune of Concepción, which I believe may be of great interest to study, pilot and implement from the MINSAL in other communes. It is a virtual Mental Health Center, attached to the APS, but with a line of work of greater clinical specialization and frequency of interventions appropriate to what the scientific evidence supports in terms of treatment effectiveness, bringing treatment processes closer from virtuality. The project that I had the opportunity to create and coordinate, gave us as results 49% clinical discharges and 96% user satisfaction, in addition to a high number of community interventions (workshops, support groups, training, etc.), and the meeting spanned 1 hours, 0 minutes.

    The discussion covered The María Ayuda Corporation has been working for 40 years to recover the dignity and claim the rights of children and adolescents (NNA) in situations of abuse, physical and psychological violence, sexual abuse and abandonment, which generates complex traumas in them, requiring multidisciplinary and specialized work, which allows to re-signify these life experiences, in a warm and familiar environment so that they can grow as whole and happy people, thus transforming their life trajectories in a sustainable way. Currently, a significant percentage of the children and adolescents we serve require specialized attention in mental health. Therefore, we see it necessary to make this data known so that children can receive care and treatment from highly specialized professionals. Ignacio Concha (executive director) and Jorge Gomez (commercial director) of Maria Ayuda participate in the lobby. María Ayuda has residential programs for children and adolescents under state care, with a presence from Arica to Temuco. They are in the process of transitioning to family residences, for 12 children or adolescents, from 6 to 12 years old.

    The discussion covered The lack of resources and access to innovative therapies is one of the major limitations at the public level for the treatment of cancer. The incorporation of LENVATINIB in the GES basket represented a quantum leap for the treatment of REFRACTORY THYROID CANCER since patients only had access to a drug through DAC that was much inferior in potency and safety. In addition, the laboratory presented an economic proposal where the innovative drug (lenvatinib) was cheaper than sorafenib. There is a second indication (HEPATOCARCINOMA) where the proposal was presented, but ETESA only considered Global Survival and the total number of Adverse Effects as parameters. The REFLECT study (Head to Head lenvatinib vs sorafenib) showed that the response rate of LENVATINIB was 24% vs 9% of sorafenib (the approved first-line immunotherapy Atezolizumab/Avastin has a response rate of 29%). Furthermore, the most relevant adverse effect of LENVATINIB is Hypertension and not the complicated hand/foot syndrome... metrics that were not considered, although the Overall Survival in this study was not statistically significant (it was a non-inferiority study) the median OS of LENVATINIB is greater than that of sorafenib. As additional data, the cost of treatment at therapeutic doses (12 mg Lenvatinib and 800 mg sorafenib) is cheaper with LENVATINIB, we estimate that the savings for the MINSAL only by replacing the drug financed by DAC (sorafenib) would reach about 200 million per year., and the meeting spanned 1 hours, 0 minutes.

    The discussion covered In view of the ISPCH's response, we are writing to you so that we can receive an audience so that we can respond to our members regarding what authority and how the authorization of orders to acquire and prescribe psychotropic drugs is executed, according to article 32° of the regulations of the field. TOPICS ADDRESSED IN THE MEETING:For the College of Veterinary Doctors (CMV), one of its objectives is to promote access to psychotropic and narcotic drugs in a safe and responsible manner, since the veterinary drugs registered in SAG are few and do not cover the needs for the care of their patients. They comment that their greatest concern is centered on the interpretation of the MINSAL regarding the use of narcotic and psychotropic drugs and specifically in article 32 of the regulation DS 405/1984 of the MINSAL, since it indicates that psychotropic drugs could be acquired and prescribed by veterinarians through orders authorized by the health service. They point out that they have sent a query to CGR specifically about this article. In addition, they are concerned that as health professionals they do not have public registration, which would be making it difficult for them to practice their profession correctly. Thus, there are problems with the lack of registration of veterinary medicines and how to access the orders authorized by the Health Service. They state that conversations with different authorities (Public Health Institute, SEREMIs, Ministry of Health and SAG) on these matters have been going on for more than 10 years, without a solution to what they are raising, and the idea is to have a solution for the practice of veterinary medicine. The MINSAL comments that we have received countless queries regarding the issues raised, including from the CGR requesting a technical opinion regarding article 32 of DS 405/1984, which was sent to the Legal Division of this Ministry. We are currently awaiting the decision of this Division. The College of Veterinarians indicates that they are forming a technical committee to deal with the issues of acquisition and prescription of medicines by Veterinarians, stating their intention that the MINSAL participate in this. The Ministry requests that they send a formal letter addressed to the Undersecretary of Public Health so that she may designate, if she so deems it necessary, the representative of the Ministry who will participate in this committee., and the meeting spanned 0 hours, 40 minutes.

The composition of the technical area of Complementary Medicines is explained from the second half of 2017 to date and it is specified that by indications The leadership of that time began to develop a public policy on this matter, with its corresponding action plan, which is expected to be published soon. This document outlines a route for the institutionalization and development of these practices at a national level. It is highlighted that one of the relevant aspects of the action plan is to reduce the existing regulatory gap, since there is currently a significant number of therapies that are carried out both in the public and private sectors and there are only 3 recognized and regulated (acupuncture, homeopathy and naturopathy), for which during 2023 the process of modifying Decree No. 42 of 2004, "REGULATION FOR THE EXERCISE OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICAL PRACTICES AS AUXILIARY HEALTH PROFESSIONS AND THE PREMISES IN WHICH THEY ARE PERFORMED", began with the purpose of updating it and being able to accommodate the recognition and/or regulation of a greater number of practices. Once the modifications to Decree No. 42 of 2004 are approved, the decrees that recognize and regulate acupuncture, homeopathy and naturopathy will be updated, and then continue with the recognition and/or regulation of those therapies that are registered in the REM-A31 of Complementary Medicines (25 unregulated), according to the priority criteria established in article 4 of Decree No. 42 of 2004. The structure of the REM-A31 is broadly disclosed and the way in which the reports of the benefits with complementary medicines delivered in individual and group care in public health establishments at the different levels of care are carried out.

    The discussion covered Proposal for joint work to address regulatory issues (reliance, advanced therapies, registration, etc.).TOPICS ADDRESSED AT THE MEETING:CIF presents the chamber's strategic prioritiesRegistration of biological drugs (specific times)e.labeling projectExternal quality controlRegistration of advanced therapyCIF reports an increase in the registration time for biological pharmaceutical products, despite the fact that the time limit is 6 months, established in DS3. Currently, this type of health registration has an average processing time of 24 months. CIF requests the implementation of a trusted registration system with countries with high health surveillance. E-labeling Joint project between the University of Concepción and ISP Study of Perception of the brochure (on paper) measures usability, assessment and perception. In a second stage, access to the brochure would be implemented by means of reading a QR code. External quality controls CIF proposes that Chile is one of the 4 countries that requests batch-by-batch quality controls of finished imported products. Registration of advanced therapies CIF proposes that DS3 includes gene therapy within biological products. CIF proposes to modify the regulation and separate gene therapy as a new group. DIPOL is interested in minimizing delays in health registrations. DIPOL states that accelerated health registrations for biological products are not regulated and that the ISP has a role in ensuring the quality of pharmaceutical products. CIF mentions that Singapore's proposal does not respect accelerated health registrations. CIF states that in the context of the lobby meeting with the ISP, records with a one-year delay would be reviewed. DIPOL requests to disaggregate data on health registration processing time by therapeutic objective in order to determine whether there is a group of medications that is responsible for the delay in processing due to a technical or other problem. CIF requests to resume discussion regarding external quality control at another time. CIF indicates that reading the QR code to access the brochure allows obtaining information regarding the place where the information is accessed and the complete traceability of the product. DIPOL raises questions regarding privacy and the use of data. A meeting is requested to further discuss the scope of e-labeling. DIPOL is committed to obtaining information regarding the delay in registrations., and the meeting spanned 0 hours, 30 minutes.

    The discussion covered Inforedchile.cl is an exclusive portal for information at a national level with an emphasis on the public interest and of a general nature, for which we want to see the possibility of generating an alliance that allows us to help disseminate information that they have, such as public health establishments at a national level since we have an old and outdated database that perhaps if they have it via API, an automatic integration can be achieved.

They point out that they currently use the API of Pharmacies on Duty and that it corresponds to one of the most consulted data within their site. They are working on a restructuring of their website in such a way as to include 5 axes, one of them is health and in this context there is a lot of useful information for the population and that from their role they can collaborate in the dissemination to the user. The comparator platform is consulted Regarding prices and their continuity, it is noted that it is currently being restructured. The Inforedchile representative points out that they have developed a search engine that is very useful in finding information. Based on the most frequent searches, it consults the data of Health Establishments and ELEAM, and it is noted that the Ministry does not have the ELEAM information published, however, Senama, through the eleamchile.cl page, is the official source of publication of said information. In the case of health establishments, the DEIS (Department of Statistics and Health Information/MINSAL) is the official source of publication. Both do not have APIs available, but the feasibility of having an API with ELEAM information in the future will be reviewed internally. The address of the datos.gob portal (https://datos.gob.cl/dataset/farmacias-en-chile) is provided via meeting chat, where the 2 APIs that this Department has available to the population associated with pharmaceutical establishments are published, which include the list of pharmacies in the country and the pharmacies on duty with daily updates.

    The discussion covered Compliance with ET for solids and liquids whose deadline ends on March 31, 2024. Compliance with the deadlines established by DSN ° 3 for the registration of biological products. TOPICS ADDRESSED IN THE MEETING: The Sanitas Institute is a company with more than 100 years dedicated to the pharmaceutical sector. For some time now, the search has begun for biological products that meet bioequivalence and biosimilarity standards. Given the experience with biological products, one focus is insulins. Insulins with registration from high surveillance agencies such as the USA are being brought in and 7 molecules have been submitted for registration with the ISP, most of which are insulins and others are oncological such as Bevacizumab (solid tumors) and bone marrow stimulators such as Pegfilgrastim. The expectation is that it will take 24 months to obtain the registration resolution. However, the admissibility resolution was only obtained after 24 months and the ISP has not made any progress in the information review process. For insulins, the admissibility resolutions were obtained in June 2022, about 24 months after completing the process. The company has made inquiries through OIRS and the responses do not indicate that the registration requests have begun to be reviewed. These products are to participate in tenders with Cenabast, allowing savings for the state. ISP informed them that Pegfilgrastim and Bevacizumab will be reviewed in March. MINSAL reports that we are informed of the delays of the ISP in matters of registration of biological products, which is mainly due to the fact that during the pandemic the teams had to dedicate their efforts to the registration of associated COVID vaccines, delaying the registration of other requests and producing a significant waiting list. Likewise, it is important to consider that the number of requests for biological product registrations has increased recently, which has not gone hand in hand with an increase in staff, since these tasks require qualified personnel in these areas, which is difficult to find. As another point, the company reports that they would encounter complications in complying with the deadlines for therapeutic equivalence due to the incorporation of burkholderia analysis in liquid medications. The company asks about the extension of the deadlines for bioequivalence of solids and liquids, which will expire soon. The MINSAL reports that the department is evaluating the general situation and in particular of each medication, in order to finally give recommendations to the authorities regarding the possibility of extending the deadlines., and the meeting spanned 0 hours, 30 minutes.

    The discussion covered Along with greetings, I request an audience in order to learn about the progress in updating the regulations that require compliance with therapeutic equivalence. In turn, we would like to know about possible progress. As owners of pharmaceutical products of utmost importance for public health, because they are medicines that impact pathologies relevant to the population, we are concerned about complying with the requirement to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence and the deadlines that the Authority has granted for this. One of these products is unique in the market and the other is being distributed by CENABAST. We have been looking for alternatives to comply with the regulations, therefore, we request a meeting to discuss the situation in detail and explore possible solutions. We especially request the presence of Mr. Alexis Aceituno, Head of the Biopharmaceutical Subdepartment, at the hearing. Your participation is essential to address the technical doubts and concerns we have about the established regulations. We appreciate your attention to this request and look forward to your prompt response. Sincerely,TOPICS ADDRESSED IN THE MEETING:The company introduces itself and indicates that there are two products that are having difficulties in the presentation of their therapeutic equivalence, thalidomide and pazopanib, and whose deadline for said presentation ends on March 31. In the case of thalidomide, it is approved for two indications. The access situation is that today this medicine is guaranteed in GES in multiple myeloma in people over 15 years of age, and in hepatocarcinoma in children under 15 years of age. The in vivo bioequivalence study is complicated to do due to the teratogenic risk, limiting the recruitment of people. This medicine was entered into the mature non-new ones, but even so they are not in a position to comply with all the requirements of these, due to a request for a formula change presented in 2011 that their product process validations are concurrent. Today, it is the sole supplier of the product, and supplies CENABAST. As of March 31, they will be in non-compliance and will have to stop distributing, which would leave patients without treatment (approximately 1,000 patients). On the other hand, Pazopanib is a product for two indications, the main one being renal cell carcinoma. It is guaranteed in GES (pathology 83 and is part of the systemic metastatic basket. Currently, the product is the one awarded by CENABAST, with only one more registration, which is the innovative one. The difficulty presented by the company has to do with carrying out the bioequivalence study, which is limited to oncology patients. A request was made to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence with other technologies through in vitro demonstration, but they have not yet had a response from the ISP. In accordance with the above, the company's interest is that the authorities can review the extension of the deadlines, be able to coordinate with ISP for the in vitro protocol and see the possibility of inclusion in the regulations of alternative in vitro methods. The MINSAL reports that in the case of EQT, they are aware of the impacts of the beginning of compliance with EQT in some products, which is why they are considering the possibility of extending the deadlines so as not to cause market distortions and inaccessibility of medications to patients. The way in which the gaps for the TQE of products will be closed will be agreed upon. ISP reports that a previous meeting was held with the company, agreeing with what was expressed by MINSAL regarding the extension of the term for products such as these. Regarding thalidomide with respect to mature non-new products, work will begin at the end of the month to re-evaluate the regulations for these. Regarding Pazopanib, alternative TQE were registered with the pertinent studies., and the meeting spanned 0 hours, 30 minutes.

    The discussion covered Discuss how to move towards the professionalization of floral therapy (Bach Flowers). Apply for the Floral Accompaniment Process and its parts as a basis for creating a solid training for floral therapists here in Chile, prospectively seeking recognition within the framework of decree No. 42. TOPICS ADDRESSED IN THE MEETING: The professionals from the Department of Pharmaceutical Policies and Regulations, Health Providers and Complementary Medicines introduce themselves and greet Mr. Lucas Sepúlveda, who does the same. Mr. Sepúlveda then points out that he is a nurse by profession and as such he coordinates a health center at the University of Los Andes, located in the commune of San Bernardo, and also works as a private floral therapist, being a concern for him that floral therapists have adequate training for caring for people. He also indicates that he has written a book, together with his wife, on Floral Therapy, which is currently being published, in which the treatment process with this therapy is explained, according to his observations with the patients he has treated. He hopes that these observations will serve to understand how it works and collaborate in the training of this type of therapists. It is explained to Mr. Sepúlveda that, in recent years, the main work of the technical area of Complementary Medicines has been the development of a public policy with its corresponding action plan, which is expected to be published soon. It is highlighted that one of the relevant aspects of the action plan is to reduce the existing regulatory gap, since there is currently a significant number of therapies that are carried out both in the public and private sectors and there are only 3 recognized and regulated (acupuncture, homeopathy and naturopathy), for which during 2023 the process of modifying Decree No. 42 of 2004, "REGULATION FOR THE EXERCISE OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICAL PRACTICES AS AUXILIARY HEALTH PROFESSIONS AND THE PREMISES IN WHICH THEY ARE PERFORMED", began with the purpose of updating it and being able to accommodate the recognition and/or regulation of a greater number of practices. Regarding Flower Therapy, it is highlighted that it is the practice that presents the highest number of benefits nationwide, according to the statistical data reported by public health establishments in the Monthly Statistical Registry of Complementary Medicines, called REM-A31. Therefore, it is expected that this will be one of the first therapies in which a process for its recognition and/or regulation will be generated in the future, once the modifications to Decree No. 42 of 2004 are approved and the regulations for acupuncture, homeopathy and naturopathy are modified. It is also reported that for the regulatory processes, working groups are generated, to which experts on the subject to be regulated are summoned, but that these processes take quite a bit of time. Mr. Sepúlveda appreciates the meeting and points out that, once his book is published, he will send a copy to this department., and the meeting spanned 0 hours, 30 minutes.

    The discussion covered Present the project to install "Punto Seguro" for household medicine waste safely.

They state that there are studies that have shown the level of contamination by medicines in the Mapocho River. Therefore, they have been looking for the elimination of medicines.They state that currently the consumer stores medicines and disposes of them through the sewerFarmacia de Similares Chile reports that it presented the initiative to the Public Health Institute to collect medicines. The pharmacy manages the waste from the pharmacy itself. The implementation cost will be assumed by the pharmacy due to a private initiative called Simi Planeta.Farmacia de similares indicated that ISP requested anti-theft measures to be considered in a pilot program at 15 points in the Metropolitan region. He also indicated that they have presented a project to the Seremi in different regions. The interest of the pharmacy is to scale up the pilot at a national level.Similar Chile Pharmacy presents “medicine collection point structure”Iron structure with a kind of chimney that prevents people from accessing the medicines. Prevents theft of medicines or the entire structure. Base anchored to the ground and covered with wood.Presentation of the process for handling unused medicinesIn the Similares Chile pharmacy there are 15 collection points located in the sales room area, with a metal structure and a wooden cover. Users directly deposit the medicines and the pharmacy employees notify a company that transports the waste to a company that carries out the first management, which may be incineration or shredding. Then a second company does the final management of the waste, generating the corresponding certificate of waste management. 60 kilos of waste have been managed in the 15 collection points, as of the second week of February. The 15 collection points are distributed in the municipalities of Vitacura, Macul, Cerrillos, La Florida, Huechuraba, Las Condes, Maipú and San Bernardo.

Farmacia de similares Chile responds that the bag can take a week to fill. There is no separation or supervision. There is no labeling of the waste, however, the bag inside the container is a red bag typical of hazardous waste.

In addition, it was suggested to remove the secondary packaging to make the collection more efficient. It also suggested a plate that diverts the medicines instead to the chimney system. DESAM indicates that a regulation of the Ministry of Health regarding clean points is pending. Legal framework would be developed.

    The discussion covered "HEALTH SOLUTIONS FOR THE TOWN OF TOCONAO, WHICH ALLOW TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF ITS PEOPLE. SLOWNESS IN BUREAUCRATIC MANAGEMENT IN THE SEREMI OF HEALTH OF THE ANTOFAGASTA REGION". This meeting was requested by the Atacameña Community of Toconao belonging to the Atacameño or Lickanantay People of the Antofagasta Region. Since it is the responsibility of the authority to be represented by professionals or advisors of their choice, this hearing is referred to the advisor of Indigenous Peoples of the Minister's Cabinet so that she may receive said representatives in audience. Initially, a connection link is sent for a virtual hearing, however, at the request of representatives of the organization, it is held in person. The following people attended this meeting on behalf of the Toconao community: Mr. Yermin Vázquez M, president; Luzvenia Catur Mamani, vice president; Mr. Guillermo González Chinga, treasurer; and Ms. Evelyn Liendro Salva, director and person in charge of the social and cultural area. While representing MINSAL, the following participate: Walter Folch, head of the Environmental Health Department; María José Arce, head of the Nutrition and Food Department; Alicia Arias Schreiber, head of the Indigenous Peoples and Interculturality Department DIPOL; and Jimena Pichinao, GABMIN Advisor. From the beginning of the meeting, the need to be received by the Minister of Health was raised, pointing out that the mandate of the representatives to their communities was raised in those terms and it is stated that if this does not happen, they will only limit themselves to raising in general terms the points that they bring to the audience, without going into further details. It is explained that the authority has the power to refer audiences to people they trust, as in this case, and it is proposed that they review the claims with the present leaders without prejudice to another meeting with authority, to which they do not agree. In general terms, the problems exposed deal with: - The Atacameña community of Toconao is one of the largest indigenous communities of the Atacameño Peoples Council (18 communities), with around 950 members, located on the edge of the Salar de Atacama, in a territory where today there are significant tensions due to lithium extraction. - There is a population of mining company workers that amounts to around 1,000 people who say they have better sanitary conditions than the native population. - They denounce a critical situation that the community is going through, aggravated by the impact of lithium extraction and which affects the lack of water, such as clean water without minerals harmful to the inhabitants of the territory, which prevents the continuous operation of the school, since the cafeteria does not have certified water. There are problems with the sewerage system. - Today, development plans cannot be articulated because development plans are not approved because they do not meet basic conditions. - Some time ago, two folders were entered into the SEREMI of Health of Antofagasta, but the results of their evaluation have not yet been delivered. They mention a lack of prioritization criteria. - Lack of resources to finance the personnel who carry out the medical rounds, they would be partially financed with community resources. Likewise, an assigned ambulance is available, but it does not have the conditions to transport patients. The meeting closes at 1:00 p.m. Agreement: GABMIN Advisor will transmit the concerns raised in the meeting, such as the need to be received by the authority during the day or the immediately following days, said meeting will take place on 04/09/2024, being received by the Minister of Health in person., and the meeting spanned 1 hours, 0 minutes.

It is reported that since this bill includes work on updating and developing regulations, the formation of a technical table with the scientific societies and professional associations associated with the subject is in the process of formalizing, in order to have their technical support. It is commented that the update of DS283 is in the process of formalizing, however, it is complex to report deadlines given that after the Legal Division it goes through review by DIPRES and SEGPRES and finally by the Comptroller General of the Republic for its promulgation. It is commented on Circular No. 24 that was made to clarify the current regulation, however, the need to standardize the criteria at a national level is understood, which is why a Checking Guideline for health authorization is being developed.

    The discussion covered Situation of the national health system. Representative of Clinics of Chile: They state that they will publicly begin to/continue to insist on the necessary fundamental reforms of the health sector. That it be complete and comprehensive. They mention that their role is to defend the providers; who require legal certainties; that mixed insurance is their preference; but that private insurance requires its own reforms; They are open to issues such as the resolution of the waiting list with the correct prices; they mention that without the private sector "it is a pipe dream to resolve the waiting list"; that the unions are a complex agenda for the public sector; that the private sector is not against the public; but that they have the flexibility to enter and leave in areas where the public sector perhaps does not have the same possibilities and flexibility; the only way to resolve the underlying problems is with "us (private providers) inside"; They mention that it is not what the public sector does wrong, but that they do not have the tools to do the same as the private sector; Matters that they think should be included in the reforms: they think the Universal Health Plan is good; But they are especially interested in knowing how Fonasa is going to be strengthened, in terms of its autonomy with greater budget management, with new tools; with the opening of spaces where technical aspects, prices, values are discussed, for which a new organization is required. Be honest about spending; review the subject of the SIL; review the mutuals (1.7% of average contribution); Establish medium and long term policies; Make the sense of urgency converse with the technical standards; the health personnel of the private sector have an obsession with accreditation and certifications; what of those costs can be taken out to reduce prices; people prioritize getting well before the "Spa clinic"; purchases by scale; the great obstacle is the medical world (30% is debt to doctors); For a 20-minute medical procedure, it is immoral that the medical fee is 1,800,000 (e.g. cataracts); It is also immoral that the average medical leave in the public world is 30 days; In response, we are grateful for the instance. Some questions are raised for reflection on the matters raised. It is also mentioned that the priority will be the committed issues., and the meeting spanned 1 hours, 0 minutes.

    The discussion covered Participants: A hearing was held with the participation of Jeniffer Riquelme and Eduardo Soto, on behalf of the Miles Organization, and Rodrigo Neira and Tamara Doberti on behalf of the Life Cycle Department of the Undersecretariat of Public Health. Objective: Within the framework of the evaluation "reproductive health is vital", the MILES organization wishes to establish this hearing to learn qualitative information on the operation of prenatal, childbirth and postpartum care services, abortion and fertility regulation between the years 2021-2023. Development: a) The main queries of the Miles organization focused on telehealth guidelines for sexual and reproductive health services, maternal mortality profile, and the operation of the oversight guidelines of Law 21,030. b) MINSAL describes that the main document on the subject of telehealth in SSRR was issued during the pandemic period, which continues to be a technical reference for local teams, which goes hand in hand with the ministerial guidance to restore and promote the continuity of services of SSRR in person. From the field of maternal mortality, the variations that this health indicator had in the context of the pandemic are explained and how the phenomenon is explained in the last decade, since although there is excess mortality like all countries in the context of a pandemic; the magnitude and causality is different and particular to the national context. Finally, it is described how the oversight process of Law 21,030 has been installed at the national level, what have been the main challenges to strengthen the health authority and what have been the advances for that. The MILES organization offers all the necessary support to continue advancing in the continuous improvement of access and quality of sexual and reproductive health services, for which MINSAL is grateful and is available for future hearings., and the meeting spanned 1 hours, 0 minutes.

    The discussion covered Search for mechanisms of agreement for joint supervision between the ISP and the Labor DirectorateDue to the urgency and importance of the issue related to the continuity of incentives in the salary structures of pharmacy workers, we propose to meet next Tuesday 23rd in the morning at the time you deem appropriate.TOPICS ADDRESSED AT THE MEETING:FENATRAFAR reports that, in a meeting with ISP, specifically with Mr. Luis Brito, regarding pending inspections on issues related to pharmacy assistants such as multifunctionality and incentive systems. At that meeting, the ISP reportedly reported that the limited capacity of HR made it incapable of responding to complaints or inspection requests.In December, an inspection was initiated regarding multifunctionality by the labor directorate. An inspection was requested from the labor directorate regarding multifunctionality and incentives. It was requested that it be joint with ISP. The result of the inspection carried out by the labour department is more than 700 million pesos in fines in only 10 pharmacy locations. ISP was asked to carry out a joint inspection, but ISP reportedly indicated that they had to ask the DT to formally make the request to ISP. A meeting between DT and ISP was held two weeks ago. FENATRAFAR says that there is interest in carrying out a joint inspection because the DT only has the capacity to issue fines. On the other hand, the ISP does have the capacity to cancel operating permits. The purpose of the meeting is to finalize an agreement between ISP and DT. DIPOL asks if it was finally agreed to carry out a joint inspection and requests the minutes of the meeting where the agreement is established that the DT carries out inspections of the pharmacies and then notifies ISP regarding the findings evidenced. DIPOL requests a copy of the minutes of the meeting between DT and ISP. In order to request background information on the agreement. DIPOL will ask ISP to prioritize joint inspection with a schedule. DIPOL will inform FENATRAFARFENATRAFAR reports that the regional ministries would be requesting documentation regarding demonstration of competencies of pharmacy assistants who obtained their certification in health services. DIPOL states that people who have a card or a resolution from a health service are recognized by the regional ministries. Pharmacy officials, through the online health authority or online regional ministries, can enter several procedures and among them there is one that is "certification of competency" then "copy of card or copy of certificate of competency" interested parties can scan the documents they have and with that the regional ministries will recognize the certificates., and the meeting spanned 0 hours, 30 minutes.

    The discussion covered Mrs. Ximena Aguilera SanhuezaMinister of HealthPresentDear Minister, I respectfully address you to request an interview with the aim of presenting our project, NATIONAL PLAN FOR INSTALLATION AND OPERATION OF HYPERBARIC CHAMBERS. This "PLAN" is designed especially and mainly to provide HYPERBARIC OXYGEN THERAPY treatment to patients with foot ulcers due to Diabetes "DIABETIC FOOT" and patients with late ulcers caused by oncologic radiotherapy "RADIONECROSIS", these diseases are among the 14 pathologies recognized worldwide to be treated with Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy according to what is established by the North American Hyperbaric Medicine Society www.uhms.com.org of which we have been corporate partners for five years. According to statistics issued by Minsal, in the last three years there are forty-three thousand fifty-three (43,053) patients amputated due to Diabetic Foot ulcers and more than two hundred thousand (200,000) patients are being cured for foot ulcers due to this same disease. On the other hand, the prevalence of Cancer in our country is approximately one hundred and sixty thousand (160,000) patients, with more than fifty thousand (50,000) new patients added each year. In both diseases, HYPERBARIC OXYGEN THERAPY is increasingly proving to be a great ally since the treatment is non-invasive, highly effective and safe, contributing to a better quality of life for patients. At the present time, there are several development projects for treatments and studies of new pathologies with Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy worldwide. It should be noted that we EQUIPSA INGENIERIA SpA together with CLINICA HYPERBARIC SpA, have developed a revolutionary model of Hyperbaric Chamber. This medical device has high technology and for five years we have been operating in two of our branches in Concepción and Las Condes. Part of our Plan includes installing at least twenty branches throughout Chile in the next twenty-four months. I would appreciate it if you would kindly grant us the opportunity to present this Plan to you, since we are convinced of the usefulness and contribution that the therapy can have on patients, generating a great social effect. Attentive to your response and/or questions, cordially sends you my regards Richard Becerra Ramos EQUIPSA INGENIERIA SPACLINICA HYPERBARIC SPA, and the meeting spanned 1 hours, 0 minutes.

    The discussion covered Present to the Minister of Health, Ximena Aguilera, the challenges and points of collaboration that Laboratorio Sandoz can contribute to improve access in Chile. Last April, the company was spun off, forming Sandoz Chile, one of the world leaders in generic and biosimilar drugs. TOPICS ADDRESSED IN THE MEETING:The company is presented, indicating that they are leaders in generic products and biosimilar drugs, with the vision of generating greater access to key medicines within global therapeutics. They report that in Chile it maintains a portfolio of 10 biosimilar drugs, which as of 04/01/2024 will be relaunched under the company "Laboratorio Sandoz", with a vision of democratizing access worldwide to biosimilar products and continuing to expand the product portfolio. They point out that they are present in public purchases of medicines, as suppliers in the coverage associated with Law 20,850; to the High Cost Drugs Initiative “DAC” of the MINSAL; as well as participating in the supply of medicines for the GES coverage; being an important supplier for CENABAST, participating in the drug coverage of the network and of the community pharmacies, the latter through the “CENABAST Law”. They state that they are part of PROSALUD, a trade association of laboratories with presence in Chile, in which they promote the creation of a working group to generate greater penetration and use of biosimilars in local markets; as they represent products that generate substantial savings for health systems, allowing greater access and stimulating innovation and development. They indicate that in their view there are regulatory, administrative and factual barriers to the expanded use and interchangeability of biosimilar medicines and highlight foreign experiences, where for example the European Medicines Agency (EMA), with many years of experience in the use of biosimilars, has allowed the interchangeability of medicines that it has registered as "biosimilars". According to their calculations, it indicates that if the interchangeability of biosimilar medicines were allowed, great savings could be had for the State. They express to be aware of the "Regulatory Agenda" of the MINSAL, which has opened up to the possibility of reviewing the substitution and interchangeability of biological medicines, offering from now on their technical assistance to advance in the matter., and the meeting spanned 0 hours, 30 minutes.

    The discussion covered Dear Sirs, we would appreciate if you could discuss the level of scope of decree 18 for brachytherapy at the Clinic, since it is not a radiotherapy center but only provides isolated brachytherapy services for prostatectomy patients. TOPICS ADDRESSED IN THE MEETING: The representatives of the radiotherapy unit of the Santa María Clinic inquire about the presence of the DT of the Radiotherapy Unit and whether this requirement is supported. Please be informed that since 2018, Regulation No. 18, on Oncologic Radiotherapy, has been in force and that its article 7 states: Article 7. - The technical direction will be exercised by a physician-surgeon, with a specialty in oncologic radiotherapy. His working hours, which must allow him to fulfill his duties, may not be less than 4 hours a day affected by the respective attendance control. This must be reported to the health authority. In the absence of the technical director, a list of replacements with the same professional training must be established, with contracted hours of equal length, which will be notified to the health authority. It should be noted that the requirement for the TD's permanence corresponds to the operating hours of the Oncology Radiotherapy Unit, therefore if in the hypothetical case that this unit operated 1 day a week, these hours must be declared in the application for health authorization, and in the resolution, these are the operating hours that will be authorized and it is the time according to the TD's permanence that will be required., and the meeting spanned 1 hours, 0 minutes.

    The discussion covered Contacted by Josefina Letelier Larraín, attorney, representing Dr. Macarena Ross Ortiz, scholarship holder of the 2022 EDF Admission competition for the Subspecialty of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in the Pontificia Universidad Católica training service, according to a public deed of judicial mandate under Repertory No. 554-24 of Notary Celis. My client has been a repeated and systematic victim of discrimination due to her medical diagnosis due to a sexual assault event experienced in her previous stage of assignment. These discriminatory events have made it impossible for the fellow to continue in the Subspecialty, as they have a decisive impact on her evaluations, to the point where she is negatively evaluated because “she is not the Macarena from before” referring directly to her sexual trauma event. Currently, the training center insists on ignoring the academic faculties and outstanding results of Dr. Ross (which are, moreover, impeccable, since she has never failed a single subject or rotating exam), forcing her to assume a state of “major remediation” that would expose her to removal from the program if she does not meet extremely high demands that have never been required of any other fellow. In this context, the Catholic University has approved the suspension of her Subspecialty due to “lack of a safe space for learning” (you can attach internal suspension request emails and the aforementioned signed document). Therefore, we urgently need your help to evaluate the relocation of Dr. Ross so that she can continue her training at a university that ensures an environment free of violence and discrimination, and to analyze her current situation regarding the relocation of her job., and the meeting spanned 1 hours, 0 minutes.

Please note that working as a dentist in a procedure room does not require an assistant or technician, as indicated in Circular No. 40/2011. Finally, it is reported that we are working hard with MINEDUC to do a pilot project in the north for the training of the dentistry mention for TENS who are already practicing, particularly the TENS that the lobbying company would have previously raised and others that may arise according to local needs. There is a commitment to keep you informed regarding the efforts that are being developed, so as soon as we have clarity with clear dates we will send an email with the progress., and the meeting spanned 0 hours, 30 minutes.

    The discussion covered Voluntary suspension of distribution of the pharmaceutical product Nystatin oral suspension 100,000 IU/mL, Health Registration B-3004/23 (previously F-134474-19), in order to prevent a health summary from being initiated against it following the issuance of RE No. 5263 of September 2023, which reclassifies the medicine as a biological (modifying only the type and registration number), and RE No. 13670, which rejects the request to deplete stock. The meeting is requested urgently given the supply crisis of Nystatin, a medicine that is part of the National Formulary, following the decision taken by BPH, the sole health registration holder of said pharmaceutical product nationwide. It should be noted that the drug is used, among other things, as an adjuvant therapy for people with cancer.TOPICS ADDRESSED AT THE MEETING:The company adds to the background indicated in its meeting request that, in September 2023, the ISP reclassified the product "Nystatin Oral Suspension 100,000 IU/mL" as a biological drug, assigning it a new registration number and ordering the labels and brochures of the product to be modified, which in practice implies only modifying the registration number listed on those materials, without changing any other characteristic of the product or its labeling.The aforementioned ISP resolution granted a period of 6 months to "exhaust stock" of the packaging materials and brochures available on the date of its issuance and implement the required modifications; in view of which, in April 2023, the company requested additional authorization to exhaust stock of the labeling materials listed in the previous registration and available in its imported products; but this was denied by the Public Health Institute, a resolution against which an appeal for reconsideration with a claim for subsidy was filed, which has not yet been resolved by the ISP. Currently, BPH would be in a position to comply with the conditions required for the new labels and brochures, only from next year since it is an imported product and it keeps units with old labeling in its warehouses for a volume of approximately 20,000 units. They report that, to date, they have lobbied the ISP to try to extend the terms of use of the old labels, but they have been informed that the definition falls on the legal bodies of that institution, given the current processing of their request and the administrative appeals initiated. They indicate that they are currently suspending the distribution of the product, this on a voluntary basis (as of April 2023), a decision taken due to failure to comply with the labeling requirement, thus avoiding possible violations of the regulations; It is also noted that the costs and times involved in the reconditioning process - which could be an alternative to adjust to the new requirements - are of impact in relation to the imminent need for distribution; especially considering the clinical essentiality of the product and the urgent need for its use. It is requested that background information be sent in relation to the supply problems that the suspension of distribution could imply in this case (such as unfulfilled purchase orders) and it is reported that the risks associated with the aforementioned suspension will be evaluated together with the health care network bodies., and the meeting spanned 0 hours, 30 minutes.

    The discussion covered Dear Yocelyn,Nice to meet you. How are you? Let me introduce myself. My name is Luis Felipe Abarca and I am the director of studies at the IntelLat consulting firm. Our consulting firm conducts the study to prepare the IntelLat Ranking of the Best Hospitals and Clinics in Latin America. Our Ranking has been in existence for 16 years, is published annually, and includes 9 dimensions of hospital management, including Safety and Clinical Outcomes, Efficiency, Technology, Sustainability, among others. Attached is the methodology of our study and a link to the 2023 publication (Ranking published). We are currently working on the 2024 Ranking, which will also include separate rankings for the specialties of Oncology, Cardiology, Gynecology and Obstetrics, and Pediatrics. In 2023 we had 46 hospitals and in 2024 we are already close to 60 hospitals. All of these hospitals are among the most prominent in their respective countries, such as the Hospital Italiano and the Hospital Universitario Austral in Buenos Aires, the Albert Einstein and the Sirio-Lebanés in Brazil, the Ricardo Palma Clinic in Lima, the ABC in Mexico City and the Zambrano Hellion of Tec Salud in Monterrey. In addition to the Ranking, we developed a data platform on hospital management, called Hospimetrics, which allows hospitals to perform detailed benchmarking. For example, the Ranking gives access to a hospital's overall evaluation of Safety and clinical outcomes (each hospital obtains a score out of 100 according to a detailed evaluation based on quantitative and qualitative indicators), and on the Hospimetrics platform that hospital can access to compare its performance in 39 Safety and clinical outcomes metrics, such as Operative mortality rate. We would very much like to meet with you to show you our work. We believe that it may be interesting for the public hospital network in Chile. We would love to include more Chilean public hospitals in our study. Currently, we have the Sótero del Río Hospital. In addition, we would like to delve deeper into the way in which private hospitals are audited in Chile. Historically, we have not included many Chilean private hospitals in the study. Kind regards, Luis Felipe Abarca Zárate Director of Studies IntelLat Consultant Meeting held June 4 at 10:00 a.m. Attendees: Yocelyn Price Susana Fuentealba Luis Abarca/ Intellat Ricardo Zisis/ Intellat Agreement: New meeting will be held with the Head of the DIGERA Division and technical representatives, and the meeting spanned 1 hours, 0 minutes.

    The discussion covered To know the guidelines of the future Regulation of Law 21,646, in order to modify requirements for suppliers, ensuring that cosmetic products are not tested on animals. TOPICS ADDRESSED: The DJ SpA Investment Company requests a lobby meeting to clarify its doubts regarding the implementation of Law 21,646, which modifies legal bodies to prohibit animal testing in the production of cosmetic products and the sale, marketing, importation and introduction into the national market of said products when they have been tested on animals, which comes into force on January 25, 2025. The company is an importer and distributor of national and international cosmetic products, so they consult the status of the regulation that the law indicates must be issued, the types of certifications that the health authority will request to prove that the products and their ingredients have not been tested on animals, who will monitor compliance with the provisions of the law, the responsibilities that would fall for not complying with the provisions, especially on distributors, if there will be a list of the products that have certified that they have not been tested on animals, whether the ingredients that have been tested on animals will be banned in the country even though they are authorized in the international reference lists, what logos will be authorized to label products that have not been tested on animals and what certifications could be requested from manufacturers/importers so that they, as distributors, could verify that the products have not been tested on animals. Please be advised that the regulation that Law 21,646 mandates is still under evaluation by the Public Health Institute and this Ministry. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Health Code states that the competent authority in matters of cosmetic products is the Public Health Institute, so once these provisions are published in the regulation, it is the one who would be responsible for their supervision. The regulations will indicate the certificates or documents that must be submitted to the health authority to prove that the product and its ingredients have not been tested on animals, the logos that may be used on the labels of these, the health sanctions and the responsibility of the different actors in the industry in this matter, as well as the form and time for the implementation of these provisions by the regulated parties.

    The discussion covered Tyroid Print® is a matrix that allows the evaluation of 10 genes using the real-time quantitative PCR technique for samples of indeterminate thyroid nodules. The product was presented together with the economic benefit associated with its mass use, which is estimated at an approximate 24% reduction in the expenditure related to indeterminate thyroid nodules, by avoiding unnecessary surgeries. The main objective of the lobby was to request the codification of this test by FONASA. ANACAN has pointed out that, in general, FONASA codifications are intended for general techniques and not for specific tests for particular pathologies. However, there is an applicable code for real-time PCR (801011: Real-time PCR for tumor markers in histological sections, which includes microdissection and DNA extraction), which could be used in this case. The company is recommended to contact FONASA to inquire about the possibility of using this code for billing the use of Tyroid Print®., and the meeting spanned 0 hours, 30 minutes.

    The discussion covered Application status Payroll 2552557TOPICS ADDRESSED AT MEETING:Heel states that it has been marketing a product called heel-kit globally.There was a change in the formulation of one of the products of the combination pharmaceutical product.Heel states that, although there have been changes to other products, they did not require changes in the registration. However, ISP would have requested a change in registration of the product due to the change in the formulation and the change in the registration of the combination product.ISP rejected the registration attemptHeel says that the registration of heel kit had been renewed even with the new regulations. Heel therefore filed a complaint with the Ministry of Health. Heel asks if there are technical antecedents regarding the exclusion of products in combination with homeopathic products. Dipol responds that it does not have access to the arguments that were used in the elaboration of the norm. Heel states that the regulations are dynamic and that in its opinion a modification is required that allows the registration of pharmaceutical products in combination with homeopathic pharmaceutical specialties. Dipol responds that it cannot make regulatory changes motivated by the interest of a particular industry. And that the regulatory modifications are determined by the "working group for the coordination of regulatory activities in medicines, elements for medical use and cosmetics" through the regulatory agenda that establishes the priorities regarding the regulatory modifications. Dipol undertakes to follow up on the response to the complaint and to provide guidelines regarding the request for the attempted regulatory change. The emails of the Heel representatives are recorded: karem.needham@heel.cl and lorenzo.leyton@heel.cl, and the meeting spanned 0 hours, 30 minutes.

    The discussion covered We hereby inform you that we held a meeting through the Lobby Law with Mr. Roberto Araneda Ortega, head of the Emergency Network Department of the Ministry of Health, in which the feasibility of a healthcare project was discussed, in which issues of feasibility of a project, and of the network of healthcare centers were discussed. In which we were told that we should continue with the Division of Healthy Public Policies and Promotion (DIPOL). And it is for this reason that we request a meeting with you. The main objective of this hearing is to understand the regulations in force in the various areas of the Ministry of Health in order to comply with them and carry out a project that leads to the complete continuity of patient care. This proposal could expand health coverage and provide care to more patients efficiently. Sincerely, TOPICS ADDRESSED IN THE MEETING: General presentations are made. It is clarified that the lobby meeting is not an advisory session, but is prepared to give specific answers regarding the regulations. It is discussed how the company is prepared and that the operation is with a private SAR model, but it differs in providing continuity of care with a concept of outpatient emergency service, with an operation of 4 to 5 years. Consultation is made regarding the regulations for the execution of imaging examinations, where it is clarified what the Health Code and DTO90 / 1997 indicate regarding the exercise of paramedical assistants that is assimilated to the functions of health technicians. It is clarified that a doctor can perform all the actions of health and delegate under medical collaboration to other health professionals under medical supervision, for which reason it is important to consider in this case the legal responsibility of the doctor who must ensure the quality of the corresponding health care. We consult regarding the installation of a SAR in the private health network, where it is reported that since the health reform of 2005 it is not possible to make differences between the public and private networks, therefore, if a private person wants to install a SAR, typical of the public health network, they can do so as long as they comply with current regulations, we share the page where you can download the Checkup Guideline for the health authorization of a SAR. We consult regarding the regulations for taking samples in relation to stretchers and accessibility, mentioning what corresponds normatively. It is remembered that it is relevant for a health manager who wants to coordinate a health establishment, it is very important to know the current regulations from the Health Code and the regulations and norms that accompany it., and the meeting spanned 0 hours, 30 minutes.

    The discussion covered Registration systems: Changes regarding name and registered sex according to Law 21,120 for transgender people in health institutions and platforms (MINSAL, FONASA, IMED system, sale of bonds, medical licenses, private providers, etc.). We request information on the status of work on this matter. The delay in these changes generates a lot of discomfort, unnecessary procedures, often impossible to carry out. We seek to collaborate and express from Civil Society the need to unify the registration platforms regarding name and registered sex. Complaint mechanisms: The OIRS platform continues to declare that sex is either male or female, and makes it impossible to identify as trans, which in many cases is relevant in the context of exercising our right to complain in health systems. On the other hand, it leaves out non-binary people who have made a rectification with gender X or I, by law they are neither male nor female, so declaring one of those options on health platforms and documents corresponds to even lying. In the case of non-binary people, we also have cases that present difficulties in the first point. For all the above, it is necessary to approach the community and understand the magnitude of the problem from our side., and the meeting spanned 2 hours, 0 minutes.

    The discussion covered Current regulations on approval of biological drugsTOPICS ADDRESSED AT THE MEETING:It informs that it requested a meeting to review regulatory processes associated with the approval of orphan drugs in Chile, specifically for the approval of its biotechnological product "Glofitamab" for the treatment of patients with "Diffuse lymphoma"; this due to the delay in granting its health registration and on the recommendation of ISP, to evaluate with MINSAL potential prioritizations for its authorization (References No. RF 1857723 and No. RF 1857740, both entered in May 2022).It indicates that according to current regulations, the ordinary registration regulatory processes - to which biotechnological molecules are subjected - should take 6 months, but this does not happen in reality, there being a longer period for regulatory approval and there being no clear administrative route to date that allows priority evaluation; In their view, the latter aspect is an opportunity for regulatory improvement to make processes more efficient and improve patient accessibility to more cost-effective pharmacological treatments. They state that they have studied the subject and that for 60% of the approved health registrations there is an evaluation and approval time of 22 to 32 months, according to the "WAIT" report, developed by "Fifarma" and "IQVIA", which shows that the regulatory approval processes in Chile are one of the longest in Latin America, which delays accessibility to patients. They require the prioritization and acceleration of the regulatory approval of "Glofitamab", since it addresses the therapeutic treatment where there would be no major pharmacological alternatives; while in Non-Hodgkin B-Cell Lymphoma 65% of patients are cured with current therapies, but products are required for patients who are resistant to established therapies and who fail in their initial treatments; There is a need that would be covered by “Glofitamab”, as a third-line product, which has shown a good therapeutic response immediately after treatment and which is significantly maintained afterwards, giving complete and long-lasting remissions beyond the end of treatment. They add to the above, that the referred product has already been authorized by FDA/USA and EMA/Europe, during the year 2023 and that to date there are more than 2,100 patients treated worldwide since the start of its commercialization (in addition to the patients who were treated in the respective clinical trials). Additionally, it reports that in Chile some patients have managed to receive the therapy through a coverage for "compassionate use" (8 patients), while the drug has been requested by some local doctors in a special way because it is an orphan disease. They point out that, according to what was reported by ISP, the only option to prioritize the evaluation of the sanitary registration of "Glofitamab" is for the MINSAL to establish the prioritization, by resolution, by application of the registration abbreviation referred to in article 51° of DS MINSAL N° 3/2010. They propose opportunities for improvement of the current regulation and thus have effective mechanisms for registrations of orphan drugs and therapies advanced, such as:- Allowing prioritization of evaluation of orphan drug registration, recognized by high surveillance authorities.- Extending the application of the accelerated registration procedure to biotechnological medicines, these being relevant and latest innovation products for diseases of health importance. In the case of "Glofitamab", they also propose the possible application of article 54° of DS MINSAL No. 3/2010. It is reported that as a result of regulatory modifications made to art. 51° of DS MINSAL No. 3/2010 (year 2020), the issuance of a ministerial resolution to shorten the registration procedure for products included in MINSAL plans and programs or in the National Drug Formulary is no longer necessary; but that in any case such mechanism would not be applicable to the case under review. Likewise, it is indicated that the registration acceleration route would be only prospective and its extension to biotechnological medicines is under study. However, it is reported that the MINSAL may be formally requested to urgently have the product, taking into account its usefulness in clinical cases where there are no other treatment options., and the meeting spanned 0 hours, 40 minutes.

    The discussion covered ISP request for modification of Decree No. 3, made by means of Ordinary DD 054/21 of January 21, 2022TOPICS ADDRESSED IN THE MEETING:ALIMSA is a trade association that brings together companies related to food supplements. Since its inception, this association has attempted to promote raising food standards through regulation. They started with ISP considering that they are the technical entity to urge the regulation of this type of product, since many of these that are healthy cannot be marketed in Chile because they are not considered food or medicines. In this context, they request the creation of a new category to be able to verify the quality, efficacy and safety of this type of product through a health registry, but without the requirements of pharmaceutical registries, starting with the fact that these are generally produced in food plants. In 2022, the ISP submitted a proposal to modify DS No. 3/2010 to include a new category that would incorporate these healthy products that, without being medicines, can be attributed with supported healthy properties. Today, there are many products on the market that claim to be food supplements and that are attributed a large number of properties, cures and treatments that are not very credible, that do not have to present anything to prove them and that even appear in television commercials. From the Ministry, they are told that there is a recognition that it is not being properly regulated in the country, and that it is necessary to evaluate the best way to cover the regulation, surveillance and inspection of this type of products. Currently, in the field of health products, there is a Regulatory Agenda that mandates for the period 2024-2025 the matters that must be addressed regulatoryly and, within which, food supplements or the creation of this new category would not be found. They are encouraged to hold discussions with various actors from the Ministry of Health and the legislative branch to highlight the importance of regulating and resolving the problem of food supplements with proven health properties., and the meeting spanned 0 hours, 30 minutes.

    The discussion covered Guests: - Carolina de Pablo - Claudio Covini- Cristian Matamala - Emilia Reyes- Joaquín Pedre - Joaquín Tagle - Juan Corona - Pamela Llantén - Ramiro Cofre and Tamara Doberti. Biogen presents a risk profile for a possible shared risk agreement, they ask questions about what risk profile we need to describe from the MINSAL. The response is that specifically in AME1 we are interested in the functional results and possible combinations of therapies available for AME 1. Biogen leaves questions in chat: Would currently judicialized patients move to the possible coverage scheme? Or would they continue with their current status and the coverage scheme be for new patients exclusively? This is part of what could be discussed as part of the ARC, effectively incorporating patients already in treatment could make it more complex to establish compliance with clinical milestones. What is the current coverage criterion for a new patient with SMA type 1 who, having been proposed by their treating physician, is not a candidate for gene therapy?  Currently, MINSAL only has the acquisition and financing strategy for gene therapy with onasemnogen abaperbovec. How does the Office of Complex Chronic Conditions and Rare Diseases of DIPRECE plan to evaluate results once therapy has started? Would it be exclusively through the AD HOC Commission currently active? Evaluation by an external entity agreed upon by both parties? Would a commission be formed especially for the evaluation of results?  The best way is being explored with other countries. In general, a follow-up protocol must always be established with the milestones established in the ARC, which would be evaluated by a committee made up of people external to MINSAL. But it is also part of the ARC proposal that can be built. What is the time horizon for implementing the ARC?  We are currently working on presenting the institutional ARC proposal to the Authority as part of an ARC policy. Then we would move forward with the different providers that could make ARC., and the meeting spanned 1 hours, 0 minutes.

    The discussion covered An audience is requested with the Undersecretary of Public Health to discuss the following topics:Review of public policies that regulate medical ozone therapy in Chile.Review of the implementation of public policies on medical ozone therapy in Chile.Update of legal regulations, technical and operational aspects for the correct use of ozone therapy in ChileTOPICS ADDRESSED IN THE MEETING:Attended by the Taxpayer Carla Oliveri, the meeting begins:Presentation of the requesters of the meeting and the professionals of the MINSAL, Carla Oliveri acting on behalf of the head of the Department Juan Francisco Collao.The requesters review their experience in ozone therapy, as well as the problems and risks that the lack of health legislation on the matter can produce and request that it be regulated as Complementary Medicine (MC).They point out that ozone therapy is regulated in more than 50 countries worldwide. That by 2023 there are around 400,000 research papers, 2,000 clinical trials and some meta-analyses generating a lot of evidence about its effectiveness, especially for treating pain. They point out that they are planning a long-term research project with UFRO and refer to the compassionate use they carried out during the pandemic period, even with authorization from the MINSAL. They also point out that the equipment they use is authorized by the FDA, and that due to the lack of legislation on the matter, there are also entries of machines from China that do not have the same quality. Carmen Julia Cerda explains the regulatory framework of the MC and the assumptions for recognition and regulation of one of these practices, specifying that the recognition and regulation refers to the professions and specifies that these are auxiliary health professions and not medical professions, which are those who, according to the lobby applicants, should practice this practice. Regarding the premises where ozone therapy is performed, it is agreed that they must have authorization as a procedure room and regarding the use of the machines, it is noted that their registration is not the responsibility of the MINSAL but of the Public Health Institute since they are medical devices. She also states that, from the MC Area, we have no knowledge of the use of ozone therapy in public network establishments and that there is a Monthly Statistical Register kept in public network health establishments regarding regulated and non-regulated MC practices, which do not include ozone therapy. Carla Oliveri asks about the risks of practicing ozone therapy, to which the participants point out that, with a professional diagnosis and use of the procedure, the risks are very low, small bleeding mainly due to lack of care of the patients, but that it is a complex procedure, which introduces ozone into the body and requires specific dosages for each case. Yénive Cavieres complements what was pointed out above, proposing that they prepare a dossier to present to the MINSAL. She points out that this technical area had previously met with Dr. Isis Alvarado and they had considered that this was a clinical procedure rather than complementary medicine, especially because of the approaches that support it, which is why on that occasion they had been advised to request a lobby with DIPRECE. Dr. Isis points out that they requested this lobby, but were never received. They are again advised to request a lobby meeting with DIPRECE, so that this Division can evaluate ozone therapy as a medical procedure, given that, in the opinion of the MC technical area, this is not complementary medicine. The relationship is made with the use of hyperbaric chambers for the evaluation at DIPRECE. Héctor Duchens requests guidance regarding who to contact at MINSAL to provide relevant information on new surface disinfection systems. It is recommended that you request a lobby meeting with the head of the Environmental Health Department of the Division of Public Policies and Promotion of Health (DIPOL). Given the apprehensions that there will be no response to the request for a meeting that will be made to DIPRECE, it is explained that today there is a very good response from MINSAL to attend these meetings. Dr. Isis agreed to request said meeting and send a dossier to DIPRECE and also to this technical area., and the meeting spanned 0 hours, 30 minutes.

    The discussion covered There are courses and diplomas from training organizations that promote labor intrusion. In particular, we have noticed how training companies offer courses in kinesiology on the national market on the evaluation, diagnosis and treatment of swallowing disorders, with swallowing being a function that belongs exclusively to the practice of speech therapists. This encourages unqualified professionals to end up carrying out health actions for which they are not trained, because training in Chile on this topic is from speech therapists, experts in communication, swallowing and nutrition. This is supported by the transversal recognition of the discipline by the advances in projects and indications to modify book V of the health code. However, both the professional college of kinesiologists, as well as other training companies, insist on generating professional training for these functions, aimed at non-speech therapists. We need to talk to the authority regarding how to deal with this unfortunate situation and to present our background., and the meeting spanned 1 hours, 0 minutes.

    The discussion covered request to expose the situation that occurred with the Public Health Institute in which it was requested to take into consideration the decision made by the institute in relation to the setting of shifts for our pharmacy despite the fact that its exemption had been requested for reasons of personal security, which constitute a crime and are reported to the local prosecutor's office, a process that was accepted by the institute and nevertheless the department in charge of this shift scheduling also did not consider the situation described and set shifts for our pharmacy throughout the current year. TOPICS ADDRESSED IN THE MEETING: Representative of an independent pharmacy in the commune of San Bernardo that began operations in June 2020, since March 2021, they began to have criminal problems in the pharmacy (all supported by the complaints). In June 2022, the owner and technical director of the pharmacy suffered a foiled ambush. From that date, a series of threats and attempted robberies began at the establishment, including surveillance and surveillance of possibly criminals. In light of the facts, the owner of the pharmacy requested assistance from the prosecutor's office. The pharmacy rents the premises where it is located to a third party and by virtue of the criminal actions that the establishment has suffered, the landlord requested to limit the operating hours of the pharmacy and not to make shifts, since the pharmacy is located next to his private home, otherwise, the lease agreement would be terminated daily. In September 2023, the technical director made a formal request to ISP, in which the situation was explained and requested to exempt the pharmacy from the shift payroll due to the problems outlined. 15 business days after the presentation, the ISP responded that the above will be considered and in the next resolution the pharmacy would be exempt. The response was delivered by OIRS Folio AO005W0041886. However, in the resolution of the 2024 shifts, the pharmacy was still included in the pharmacy shifts, so a meeting was requested with Carlos Bravo from the ISP through Lobby folio AO005AW1503136, in which it was reportedly indicated that given the situation presented and all the procedures that have been carried out, the request would be granted and that the formal response would be delivered during the month of February, which has not happened to date. A series of emails have been sent to Carlos Bravo and Sergio Muñoz requesting that they consider the request for exemption from shifts to the pharmacy, otherwise they will be asked to leave the premises. From ISP they indicate that this matter is not a lobby matter and that it can be dealt with in a technical meeting, which has not been able to be held to date. In the ISP's second semester shift resolution, the establishment was again included in the pharmacy shifts. The technical director of the establishment also points out that there is a pharmacy in the sector that performs emergency shifts and it draws his attention that a pharmacy that is closed appears with shifts in the resolution. The shifts that the establishment must fulfill during the semester are approximately 6 to 8. From the MINSAL, the technical director is requested to send by email the background information of the case to request the ISP to give a formal response as soon as possible to the request made by the establishment., and the meeting spanned 0 hours, 30 minutes.

    The discussion covered am writing to you to request your help and support with my daughter's health situation, who is in an extremely deteriorated state of health due to severe malnutrition. This is the result of a total pancreatomy in which other organs were also removed. The surgery was performed at the Catholic University Clinical Hospital in Santiago, and due to the inability to continue paying for the hospitalization, a jejunostomy was placed to discharge her. Upon returning to Punta Arenas, my daughter was hospitalized the next day and has so far had three emergency hospitalizations due to pain and diabetic ketoacidosis. There are no diabetologists here with experience in type 3c diabetes, which further complicates her situation. Local doctors do not have the knowledge or specialty necessary to treat her properly, and we rely on telemedicine with her treating physician. In addition, the type of tumor she had is extremely rare and there are no studies in the medical literature that explain its behavior. She has a certificate stating that she is the first case of this type of pancreatic tumor in Chile. She has not been accepted into the oncology pain team because her condition is not in the GES, even though her treating physician certified that a sarcoma was removed. I have gathered all possible information about the surgery and have contacted more than 30 people in the US to seek help, but the distance and lack of adequate resources here in Chile have been a constant obstacle. Her treating physician has done everything possible, but the distance limits treatment options. Please consider our situation and help us arrange a referral to a private clinic that has the necessary specialists to give my daughter a better quality of life., and the meeting spanned 0 hours, 30 minutes.

In Chile, several products similar to the aforementioned have recently been registered with ISP with more than 5 holders, but in their view, the appropriate requirements have not been made to support their proper use and interchangeability.

Finally, it states that since 2019 they were informed that guidelines would be issued for the demonstration of bioequivalence of patches and similar pharmaceutical forms, asking if there is progress. In this regard, it is reported that the ISP has already been requested to build the respective Methodological Guides, with which progress can be made in the matter.

    The discussion covered Dear Minister of Health, Undersecretary of Healthcare Networks, Unit or Area of Health Promotion, I am writing to you on behalf of Fundación Logros to present a proposal that we believe will significantly contribute to the ministerial objectives of the Ministry of Health (MINSAL) in relation to health promotion through healthy eating. At Fundación Logros, we share the commitment to promote healthy eating habits and to actively collaborate in improving public health in our community. To this end, we have developed an innovative idea that we consider to be aligned with the objectives and priorities of MINSAL in terms of health promotion. Our proposal consists of establishing a pilot program to supply healthy food in hospital establishments under the jurisdiction of MINSAL in the Coquimbo Region, given the results that can be expanded to other regions. This program would focus on promoting nutritious and balanced nutrition, as well as supporting small entrepreneurs and local farmers. Through this program, we are committed to providing fresh and healthy food from small producers in the communities where the hospitals are located, in partnership with Municipalities. This initiative will not only promote the health of patients and visitors to the hospitals, but will also contribute to the economic development of local communities and the strengthening of family farming. We understand that the MINSAL, in agreement with Public Health, has a genuine interest in promoting healthy eating and we believe that there can be no better scenario and showcase than in the hospital health facilities themselves, demonstrating by example and demonstration that it is possible to achieve. We believe that our proposal offers a unique opportunity to advance these objectives in a collaborative and effective manner. We would like to request a meeting with you and your team to present our proposal in detail and discuss possible forms of collaboration. We are open to any comments or suggestions you may have and we look forward to the opportunity to collaborate and work together on this important initiative. We appreciate your attention in advance and arouse your interest with our proposal. We remain at your disposal to coordinate a meeting at a time that is most convenient for you. Sincerely, FUNDACION LOGROS_________Development of the meeting:Presents a project to install food dispensers with healthy products and install sales modules for this type of products in health facilities. Possibility of a pilot plan at the Ovalle Hospital and, based on that experience, include it in another hospital in the region. Generate income for social programs carried out by the foundation. The products would be purchased by producers in the commune. The machines are forgotten as a bird lounger. They ask if it would be possible to purchase this type of vending machine through promotional resources and transfer it on loan to the foundation so that they can take care of its maintenance and supplies. They also want to incorporate talks in waiting rooms by nutritionists. MINSAL explains that the three-year health promotion plans are plans proposed by the municipalities and that MINSAL does not have the possibility of making direct allocations for the financing of projects. They may eventually consult with the respective health service to assess whether they have the legal and budgetary framework to carry out a project of this nature., and the meeting spanned 0 hours, 20 minutes.

    The discussion covered Illegal practice in podiatry. Primary care supports it. Clarification section Technical Guidance "Comprehensive Management of the Diabetic Foot", of the year 2018, regarding the type of professional who should provide care. Clarification Regulation 951/62 Modification, Differentiation of the professional graduates of Otec and professionals graduates of Institutes accredited by the mineduc. Illegal practice of the profession.? We request clarification and pronouncement from the competent authority. The aforementioned technical guidance, in its section No. 6.1, distinguishes two types of podiatry: preventive, which has as its objective only the care of healthy feet, and clinical podiatry, which, in addition to preventive care, includes non-invasive palliative care in feet with dysfunctions, and which must be practiced under the supervision of a health professional, within a health establishment. The document then specifies that the health personnel who can treat diabetic foot are those who have a degree in clinical podiatry technician or podiatry technician, whose titles are conferred under the conditions mentioned and by officially recognized entities in accordance with the applicable regulations. According to the technical guidelines of the Ministry of Health, the management of a health complication such as diabetic foot is not consistent with the nature of the functions that can be performed by podiatrists (Non-technical professional, Nursing technician with a mention in podiatry) who have been authorized by the respective Seremi, in light of the provisions of article 2 of the regulations of the branch. Then the hiring of such professionals is objectionable, with the health ministry itself governing and setting the regulations for said area. TOPICS ADDRESSED IN THE MEETING:A presentation is made by the attendees.President of the Professional College of Higher Level Technicians in Clinical Podiatry of Chile AG presents a normative analysis and exposes the irregularities that exist with auxiliary podiatrists.Posters of the existing courses in Podiatry are presented, with the Seremi logo and information presented as misleading advertising.It is clarified that the training depends on MINEDUC, that the logo of the courses that have SENCE certification is from the Ministry of Labor and Social Security. That the MINSAL does not approve courses for Podiatry, therefore it is not appropriate to use a Seremi logo and that to request the use of the MINSAL logo, sponsorship must be requested. It is mentioned that whenever misleading advertising is detected, there is the possibility of reporting it to SERNAC. It is also mentioned that a bill is in process that "Modifies the Health Code to regulate the practice of different professions in the health area as part of a medical team", Bulletin 13806-11 and consolidated (a public access link is shared for monitoring), highlighting that the processing of this bill comes to recognize super level health technicians, in general, which would allow the recognition of higher level podiatry technicians in the podiatrist regulations. This regulation is ready to be processed and includes the instructions of the Comptroller General of the Republic in the opinions that were mentioned, but it is expected to be processed after the Modification of the Health Code, otherwise it will be necessary to update it again with the new regulations. It is reported that within the framework of the aforementioned bill, the Ministry of Health has detected that, naturally and given the advances in technology and science in the country, there is a technical nature of the auxiliary professions regulated to date, which is why it is necessary to continue advancing in recognizing technical training to accompany the process of extinction of auxiliary professions. It is recalled that this division and the department in particular see policies and regulations in the area of health providers in the public and private areas, which is why the indications or procedures carried out by the Undersecretary of Healthcare Networks with its divisions (DIVAP-DIGERA) are not within our jurisdiction. For the above reasons, we cannot comment on the technical standards or technical guidelines for diabetic foot that have been issued; we can only mention the legal framework that these standards must be governed by., and the meeting spanned 0 hours, 30 minutes.

    The discussion covered Currently our company offered in two tenders to the Talca Hospital, both of which tenders infringed illegalities and irregularities, which were entered as a claim and have not been answered, where in addition we tried to contact the administrative deputy director of the Hospital where the secretary indicated that he was not going to respond to anything, neither emails nor calls, a fact that caught my attention since they are public servants so they should have access to citizens and even more so a state supplier, then we tried to contact the director of the hospital and was unsuccessful, this is why we requested a meeting with the minister to deliver the background of the irregularities that are carried out in a ridiculous and shameless manner since the bases of the tenders are clear and the evidence of this is precisely what we want to deliver to the minister so that she adopts the necessary measures and those responsible are sanctioned., and the meeting spanned 1 hours, 0 minutes.

    The discussion covered Dear Sir,I would like to ask for this audience to introduce ourselves as a physical and online pharmacy that wants to see ways to help and coordinate with respect to the implementation of electronic prescriptions, their sale and traceability, since we have a batch traceability system that would allow us to match it with the prescriptions and contribute to the objectives of the DIPOL.Best regardsTOPICS ADDRESSED IN THE MEETING:Farmacia Loop is an online pharmacy that helps reduce the destruction of medicines and brings medicines closer to chronic patients. They look for medicines with a short expiration date with suppliers and sell them to patients with up to an 80% discount. They have a physical pharmacy but they mainly trade medicines through electronic commerce, so they have adapted to the electronic commerce regulations. Their proposal is to have the shortest possible logistics chain so as not to make the product of pharmaceutical products more expensive. They are aiming for solidity and security in the protection of data. It has a traceability system where drug batches are associated with patients as a safeguard due to the short expiration date of drugs. On the web platform, they sell drugs and report their expiration dates so that patients can buy in an informed manner. They want to present the traceability platform to the MINSAL and see if it can be integrated with electronic prescriptions, in order to enhance their electronic commerce and see the possibility of creating a protocol for the electronic commerce of drugs subject to legal control whose sales condition is that of a check prescription. They are informed that the MINSAL is evaluating policies that allow the traceability of drugs from their inception to the patient, so it would be interesting to know the traceability system that they have implemented. Regarding the integration with electronic prescriptions, they are informed that the MINSAL is currently working to implement the electronic check prescription, which should soon be available. Once this objective is achieved, they will begin to work on the interoperability of the National Electronic Prescription System with other developments. However, it is important to clarify that today the regulations do not allow the electronic commerce of products whose sales condition is that of a prescription check, however it is feasible to evaluate the possibility of allowing it, as long as the necessary safeguard measures required by this type of product are found., and the meeting spanned 0 hours, 30 minutes.

He told me that DIVAP is in charge of the health issue regarding the Visual Health program carried out by the Chilean Government through the Ministry of Health.

We believe that this collaboration could have a significant impact on the health and quality of life of hundreds of thousands of Chileans who currently face barriers to accessing adequate vision care. We are open to discussing the details of how we could work together on this project, whether through the direct provision of optical lenses, training of health personnel, or any other form of collaboration that you consider pertinent. We remain at your disposal to coordinate a meeting or phone call in which we can discuss in more detail how VisionSpring can contribute to the advancement of this initiative in Chile., and the meeting spanned 1 hours, 0 minutes.

As a result, today they have a health unit with a doctor, nurse and TENS, whose hiring is supported by an agreement with the Municipality. The rural medical station operates on a 5x2 shift, a shift that makes it difficult for medical professionals to move around due to the characteristics of the rural territory, generating dissatisfaction and discontinuity among professionals. The community requests an evaluation of whether it is possible to adapt the 5x2 shift to an alternative that is more comfortable, thus avoiding the continuous rotation of medical professionals. They also request an evaluation of the possibility of expanding the post, since they are the only town that has a complete health team, as well as having an intercultural care box. b) Sanitary Services Don Héctor Cruz reports that another of the mandates received by the leaders, within the framework of the community development plan, is to regularize the drinking water and sewage system. This has not been possible because the applications they have made have been rejected by the health authority, despite having a team of professionals who advise them on the application and having submitted and accompanied everything required, according to them. They say that they have been unable to obtain the health resolution for more than a year and a half or find concrete answers from the institutional counterpart within the health area on what specifically needs to be corrected. When consulted by DIPOL, the applicants say that the system they have is working, that they have had conversations with the DOH (MOP) so that the Drinking Water Committee, whose constitution is required, can exist under the auspices of the community, so as not to have to constitute a new legal entity. They are waiting for what the DOH says in this regard. DIPOL states that the most fluid thing is for the process to continue developing in this way, as it has until now. For her part, Mrs. Patricia Albornoz states that they need to have accompaniment, because it is difficult to understand the grounds of the resolutions; Likewise, it highlights the need to take into account the short deadlines granted to them to remedy the problems, given the conditions of isolation and rurality in which the community is located. When the applicants were asked if they had requested an audience with the SEREMI of Health, they reported that they were referred to professionals from the technical team without obtaining any clarifying guidance. They asked for help, through us, to arrange an audience with the regional authority to appoint someone who can understand the background that the community, with its full team of professionals and advisors, has presented, stating "it cannot be that even with all that team something cannot be achieved." The professional Gabriel Vega indicates that the ideal would be to generate an instance in which the DOH (MOP), SEREMI of Health, community designer, community representatives and a professional from the Department participate. of Environmental Health-DIPOL, to address the technical aspects that need to be corrected, a proposal that is unanimously accepted.AGREEMENTSThe parties adopt two agreements to continue addressing the problems raised:a) Generate a meeting, which will be managed by DIPOL, to address matters related to health permits between the following actors: DOH - MOP SEREMI of Health DESAM - DIPOL Community Community designerb) Generate a meeting with the participation of the Undersecretariat of Healthcare Networks, managed by DIPOL, to address aspects related to the Rural Post. The topics on the agenda will include the shift system and the intercultural care box.a) Rural Medical Station MeetingThe first agreed follow-up meeting is held on August 13, 2024, attended by the Camar Community, DIVAP, and DIPOL. It presents the two requests of the Community related to the Rural Medical Station, namely, to have the enabling of an intercultural box and to have authorization to implement work shifts for medical professionals adapted to the geographical reality. In this regard, it is agreed that: DIVAP will hold a joint meeting with the Antofagasta Health Service and the SEREMI of Health of Antofagasta to address these points. DIVAP will inform the Regional Equity Table, led by the SEREMI of Health, regarding the need for intersectoral articulation to expedite requirements that do not directly depend on the health sector. b) Health permits meeting The second agreed meeting is held on September 6, 2024, attended by the Camar Community, the SEREMI of Health of Antofagasta, DOH-MOP and DIPOL. The request for support made by the Community to correct the observations made to the requests for health permits (drinking water and wastewater) by the SEREMI of Health is addressed in order for the authorization to be successful. In the instance it is agreed that: During the week of September 9 to 13, the parties involved will send each other a series of background information that will be recorded in the minutes. Once the background information has been received by the DOH, it will indicate to the other parties involved the date range in which they could generate suggestions to support the steps to come in the authorization request., and the meeting spanned 1 hours, 0 minutes.

    The discussion covered Improving the quality of hormone therapy provided in public health centres. The current practice of cutting costs by using bioequivalent drugs is generating serious side effects in patients, such as arthralgia, skin irritations, blood pressure problems, among others. This in turn increases the cost of additional treatments to mitigate these effects. From a human rights perspective, it is imperative to ensure that patients receive quality treatments that improve their quality of life and reduce the need for additional medication. Investing in better drugs is not only an ethical measure, but also an effective health strategy to optimise the budget and ensure a decent and effective treatment for all cancer patients., and the meeting spanned 1 hours, 0 minutes.

    The discussion covered Good afternoon,Our centers work collaboratively with the public service, we provide primary medical care, free exams and procedures for low-income patients and seniors who are on the waiting list for the public service. We have 2 centers in the metropolitan region and a medical device that visits rural towns with little access to health. My concern is the organization of the waiting list statistics and the high demand of patients requesting care. To date we serve around 140 patients daily, these patients who have already received care continue on the waiting list, which generates for you an overload, volume of patients and erroneous data. On the other hand, one of our centers has 3 surgical pavilions of medium and low complexity, which is why we would like to make them available to the public network, in this way providing a solution to patients who are on the waiting list for surgical procedures. I appreciate in advance your kind response. Daniela Marín S., and the meeting spanned 1 hours, 0 minutes.

    The discussion covered As a leader in innovative technologies, our company is interested in demonstrating the VIDESK.IO Service. With Videsk, citizens will not have to go to the COMPN offices, as they only need to connect to the website and select the segment to be served. Our solution has to do with the incorporation of a video call with human attention on the website and allows support to the citizen in their procedures, both to schedule an appointment or to be served by a COMPIN agent. Its functions include the bidirectional sending of documents between the agent and the citizen. It is a new and empathetic experience, because with just 2 clicks the citizen will be talking to a representative of the COMPIN office and with personalized segmentation that is of interest to the citizen. In addition, there is no friction, the citizen does not install any plugin on their computer to communicate. We also do not use Zoom, Meet or Teams technology, it is our own development. In addition, after each video call, the citizen will fill out a survey to determine the quality of care provided by the agents. Our technology will allow them to generate greater closeness with the citizen, because in addition to being on the Web, we also include QR codes on signs at COMPIN agencies that only require the citizen to read it with their cell phone to communicate with the COMPIN representative. The COMPIN will have access to a dashboard with more than 30 metrics (number of calls, duration, wait time, etc.). In addition to the recordings of each video call, it will be able to include the new AI module to obtain valuable data to identify and manage trends. The company does not present itself., and the meeting spanned 0 hours, 30 minutes.

    The discussion covered Dear Dr. Juan Francisco Collao:It is in the interest of the Chilean Chamber of the Cosmetic Industry, AG, to request an audience to discuss two issues related to ingredients in the formulation of cosmetic products, given the dynamism and change in regulations in both Europe and the United States: 1.- Criteria and issuance of exempt resolutions or local communications when restrictions on the concentration of ingredients are prohibited or established in other geographical areas. 2.- Cosmetic Europe sent a letter to the Ministry of Health on January 25, 2024, for which there is no feedback yet. And it is in the interest of the industry to understand the criteria with which the application of the new list of allergens that Europe considers in labeling has been evaluated. We understand that Chile does not have this labeling requirement, but with the modification of regulation DS 239/02 it will be established as a new requirement and considering the long deadlines established in Europe, it will be relevant to understand the scope that will be defined in the country. Without further ado, Pilar ConaTechnical Advisor - Chamber of the Cosmetics Industry says goodbye. TOPICS ADDRESSED IN THE MEETING:The Chamber of the Cosmetics Industry of Chile requests an audience to see the status of the response to the Letter sent by Cosmetic Europe since it contains matters that are of interest to the association and its members regarding the labeling of allergenic ingredients, which will soon begin to apply in Europe, but which have given implementation deadlines of 3 years for new products entering the market and 5 years for products already on the market. Through the public consultation of DS 239/2003, aspects that regulate allergens in terms of their labeling are touched upon, so you are interested in knowing how it will be implemented. From the MINSAL we inform you that indeed the proposed modification of DS 239/2003 in harmonization with European regulations, includes the labeling of allergenic ingredients. That these will be in accordance with the reference lists and will be reported via resolution by the Public Health Institute, giving sufficient time for the industry to adapt its labels, deadlines that will be evaluated on a case by case basis. In relation to cosmetic ingredients, these will be based on the reference lists that were agreed upon in the Pacific Alliance and that the changes in restrictions in their concentrations or prohibitions will use the same mechanism indicated above, in which the Institute will report said changes, giving sufficient time for their implementation. Regarding the Letter sent by Cosmetic Europe, it is reported that it will be answered once the evaluation of the public consultation of the modification of DS 239/2003 is finished, since said letter was sent in this context., and the meeting spanned 0 hours, 30 minutes.

It informs that they have been asked as a Scientific Society to sponsor various courses for kinesiologists that involve the use of sharp materials, and when analyzing these requests, deficiencies are seen in the collection of REAS, professional training in asepsis techniques, lack of knowledge of IAAS, punctures between the same students as a common practice, techniques used in patients with obvious contamination, etc. In addition, consult as a Scientific Society we can warn and help in the solution of the problems that exist in these matters. The regulation is discussed regarding: 1. The professional Kinesiologist is legally authorized to practice his profession by Book V of the Health Code as seen below: Article 112°.- Only those who have the respective degree granted by the University of Chile or another University recognized by the State and are legally authorized to practice their professions may perform activities related to medicine, dentistry, chemistry and pharmacy or others related to the conservation and restoration of health. 2.

Likewise, they may care for patients in the event of sudden accidents or in situations of extreme urgency when there is no doctor-surgeon in the locality or, if there is, professional assistance is not possible.3.

    The discussion covered On behalf of the College of Biologists of Chile, whose mission is to ensure the labor rights and ethical practice of our members, we write to you to address the lack of formal recognition of biologists as health professionals in the Chilean health code. For decades, biologists have contributed to the conservation and restoration of human health in Chile. Article 112 of the health code and Exempt Resolution No. 1072 of the Chilean Ministry of Health of June 28, 1985, indicate that the Standards applicable to In Vitro Fertilization and Embryo Transfer require “the availability of medical specialists or biologists who are experts in the study and examination of semen.” However, this regulation is not reflected in a formal recognition that allows biologists to be considered health professionals. In Chile, biologists play crucial roles in drug development, pathogen identification, water contaminant research, in vitro fertilization processes, and genetic and molecular diagnosis. During the Coronavirus pandemic, their work was essential in identifying and studying the virus. Despite these significant contributions, the lack of recognition in the health code has led to professional discrimination that prevents them from applying for positions, signing reports, and participating in public competitions. We have a registry of biologists who have declared that they have been discriminated against and rejected in these areas. A clear example of this exclusion is found in the National Cancer Law, whose decree 42, article 14 establishes that “the Ministry of Health will promote the training, capacity building, continuing education, and specialization of human resources in cancer issues, including surgeons and other professionals in the health and science areas.” However, since the profession of biologist is not recognized in the health code, biologists face difficulties and cannot be part of this regulation, for example, as genetic counselors in cancer. It is important to highlight that in Chile there are only two diplomas in genetic counseling, both directed by biologists. The participation of biologists is crucial to advance scientific research and the application of new knowledge to improve human health. Biologists contribute significantly in areas such as microbiology, neuroscience, epidemiology, molecular diagnosis and genetic counseling, all essential fields for the well-being and health of the population. In several countries, biologists are recognized and valued as essential professionals in the field of health. In the United States, biologists are an integral part of the health system, working in multidisciplinary teams in hospitals and research centers. Their role is crucial in identifying pathogens, developing innovative therapies and making accurate molecular diagnoses. In the United Kingdom, biologists are considered health professionals and play vital roles in biomedical research and biotechnology, working closely with physicians and other health professionals to improve clinical outcomes. In Germany, biologists have a prominent presence in clinical and applied research, contributing significantly in areas such as medical genetics, pharmacology and microbiology. These examples demonstrate how formal recognition of biologists as health professionals is not only possible, but also beneficial for the continuous improvement of public health and scientific progress. Therefore, we request a meeting with this committee in order to explain in detail the objectives of our college and to advance the inclusion of biologists as health professionals in Chile. We firmly believe that formal recognition of biologists in the healthcare field is not only fair but also essential for scientific progress and the continuous improvement of public health in our country. We thank you in advance for your attention and remain at your disposal to coordinate this meeting. TOPICS ADDRESSED AT THE MEETING: It was initially reported that only people who have registered on the lobby platform can participate. The meeting began with presentations from the attendees. Mr. Ricardo Ramírez, representing the College of Biologists, points out that his aspiration is the inclusion of biologists in the Health Code, so that they are considered health professionals, as well as situations and practical cases in which they must intervene together with health teams. A presentation is made regarding the participation of Biologists in the health network. - DTO42 is presented, regarding the cancer law, and its participation in this regulation. Article 90 only mentions health professionals, excluding biologists. It shows how genetic counseling works in the world. It is presented that there is training of 2 diplomas in genetic counseling, both directed by biologists. They are not accepted to enter SOCHIAGO because they are not health professionals.

Over time until now, I have been slowing down the disease with biological medications to have less painful daily life. Having this disease totally incapacitates me from returning to the world of work, and that is why since last year my treating doctor has applied for me for a disability pension, which today has been resolved and may grant it to me partially. I have been on medical leave since day 1 fighting against this disease, stopping it so that I can have a more stable daily life, but even so, COMPIN has questioned my medical licenses and today is no exception. They are questioning my last one, which has already expired, medical leave folio: 18564848, it is my last medical leave since after that I enter the disability pension process and it will no longer be necessary to be covered with medical leaves. It should be noted that I also had problems with 5 medical licenses questioned by the compin on the dates of December 2023 to April 2024 in which you were able to help me, today I request your help again with my situation.

    The discussion covered Along with greetings, we would like to request the hearing again according to the agreements in previous hearings and with the different actors, we have tried to make contact on repeated occasions with Don Roberto Cortes, an interlocutor validated by the president of the COMPIN, the highest authority of that service, on the other hand, regarding the work table to be able to reach agreements, given that in reality the 1271 scale does not conform to the symptoms or signs or syndrome or diseases acquired post-contagion or post-inoculation of the covid 19 vaccine. The complexity of the symptoms, in poor approach, the little to almost no training or updating of professionals, the lack of medical hours with a specialist and then the outdatedness or complete ignorance. It is worth mentioning that most patients have many symptoms or signs or syndromes and primary care does not have these professionals, nor the resources. Then we face disabilities where these are poorly evaluated in % due to again lack of knowledge and expertise in the matter, it is not possible that a patient is taking 8 months to their information is entered into the databases and they can be evaluated for their various disabilities. A few days ago we had a patient user who was taken by her father to get to the COMPIN V region facilities and where the effort almost caused her to faint. She has been waiting for more than 8 months for her credentials. Then we faced the fact that the COMPINES do not comply with the Opinion of the General Comptroller's Office since public officials cannot be evaluated if they are not cured or rehabilitated or if some procedure or control is missing, as established by OPINION 66641/2015. We believe that it is essential that the worker and/or official be notified a week before they will be evaluated and that contact be made to consult if there are any pending procedures regarding their health by the respective Mutual. What has been happening with officials who were evaluated with 70% work disability does not happen again, without even mediating rehabilitation treatments, controls, exams, interconsultations with specialists, tracheal changes or aggravations of the underlying pathologies, among many other things, that each patient has reported, claimed, a humanized, inclusive, informed treatment is requested, where the official or worker is not violated. We have officials who have been discharged with symptoms or signs that are under study, pending interconsultations, rehabilitation processes that have not been completed or have not begun and that these have been seen in the real need to go to more specialized doctors and that at the forefront of Long Covd or persistent Covid and that they are kept on rest because their body does not have the physical, mental or cognitive capacity for labor reintegration and enters the vicious circle of the great fear of becoming infected again, exposing oneself and worsening. Medical licenses rejected due to chronic pain, dysautonomias, polyneuropathies, tachycardias, physical and mental fatigue, mental fog and tiredness, loss of strength. Having exposed the facts, it is again that a lobby hearing is requested to seek solutions for the patients, workers and officials.IN RELATION TO THE MEETING HELD WITH THE COVID PATIENTS GROUP PERSIST, AGREEMENTS ARE SENT: - Mrs. Paola Zapata will send the data of the three priority users for review and background report.o Margarita Mora Barrientos,, Eighth Region.- Mrs. Paola Zapata will send a first list with 15 users for background review and report dated September 30, 2024.- The National COMPIN Department will send a response to the users' background information dated October 7, 2024.- A second meeting is scheduled within the framework of the Lobby Law on October 10, 2024, at 3:00 p.m. at Mac Iver 440, 10th floor.

    The discussion covered The meeting begins with presentations by the meeting participants, a time of 1 hour is set and the floor is given to those requesting the Lobby to present the information they requested to share. Exhibitors present the molecular test "ThyroidPrint", as a molecular diagnostic tool designed for patients with thyroid pathology, which will help reduce waiting lists for thyroid surgery. This genetic-molecular test can diagnose the benignity of thyroid nodules with 95% certainty in indeterminate cases (Bethesda III or IV). The result is sent to the patient's care center within 10 days of receiving the sample. They claim that 70% of indeterminate tumors are benign and without this test today they all undergo surgery with resection of the gland and prescription of Eutirox for life, and surgery can be replaced by follow-up and controls. The patient takes the thyroid puncture sample at a center in agreement with the GENEPRO DX laboratory, the sample is transported from regions or RM to the laboratory in Santiago where it is processed as a PCR. They have studies where they follow up 51 patients for 18 months, of the total number of patients 29% were benign and 7% malignant. Avoids surgeries in 61% of patients, The publications are without conflicts of interest. Eloísa Díaz Hospitals and Hospital del Salvador make direct purchase and tender respectively of this test In summary, ThyroidPrint makes a molecular diagnosis that replaces unnecessary surgery in patients with benign nodules. Its negative predictive value is 95%, positive predictive value is 78%, specificity is 88% and sensitivity is 91%. The cost of a test for 1 patient is: $890,000 privately, $500,000 wholesale purchase, they have the option of incorporating the thyroid puncture to the test for $750,000. The surgery averages a cost of $500,000 in a public hospital, double in MLE and FONASA PAD could exceed this last figure. They tell us that compared to the expense of man hours, operating room, day of hospitalization, bed and Eutirox for life compared to a benign nodule, we have significant savings for the health sector. They have a letter of support from an expert specialist in the matter, they have had conversations with FONASA and have previously lobbied with MINSAL. They ask us to include this benefit in the basket for cancer detection and request that they be assigned a FONASA code, for which they come to us. ANACAN explains to them that all the information they require is not through Lobby, but through transparency and that this department does not have the power to add tests to baskets or instruct FONASA to create a code, however, they are offered to send all the information with the detail of the cost study and everything presented today in order to submit this information to the head office. Their contact details are requested and they are thanked for their request, the offer to collaborate with MINSAL and the information shared., and the meeting spanned 1 hours, 0 minutes.

    The discussion covered We wish to send and discuss the proposed health reform and our reflections will be attended by Camila Hernando; Jaime Saez; Jaime Peña; Andrés Couble; Danae Sinclaire; Patricio Rosas. They discussed their concerns and priorities regarding the reform bills committed to in the short law. They agree with moving forward with an anti-abuse agenda; they asked to unify positions within the ruling party prior to the presentation of the bills to avoid public tensions; Aspects of the feasibility mechanisms to eliminate pre-existing conditions and discrimination were discussed; they asked to avoid corralitos; they proposed using deficiencies and gradual elimination of pre-existing conditions; they proposed moving towards "boutique Isapres" until the conditions for a FUS are achieved; They committed to producing a document with more details of their proposals, which was received yesterday by mail. 1Analysis and proposals for a future bill to eliminate pre-existing conditions and discrimination for ISAPRE membership and benefits within health plansSeptember 20241. General framework of the Bill (PDL) that must be presented:a. Legal obligation established in the Short ISAPRE Law (Law No. 21,674): present one or more PDLs to the National Congress, before October 1, to end pre-existing conditions and discrimination based on sex and age in ISAPRE membership and benefits within health plans. Namely, the Law establishes in the second paragraph of its tenth transitory article that: "Without prejudice to the foregoing, before October 1, 2024, the President of the Republic must send to the National Congress one or more bills aimed at: eliminating the pre-existing conditions referred to in article 190 of decree with the force of law No. 1, promulgated in 2005 and published in 2006, of the Ministry of Health; as well as to eliminate discrimination based on age and sex, and the mechanisms that allow its viability, both for affiliation to Health Insurance Institutions and for restrictions or exclusions of benefits within complementary health plans". b. Limits of the legal obligation: the provisions of the aforementioned article carry the explicit obligation to submit a PDL that: i. Ends pre-existing conditions and discrimination based on age and sex, both for: 1. Affiliation to ISAPRE. 2. Restrictions or exclusions of benefits within complementary health plans. ii. Establish mechanisms that make it possible to end the limitation on affiliation with ISAPREs, as well as the restrictions or exclusions of benefits from complementary plans due to pre-existing conditions, age and sex. That is, a PDL that enables free affiliation with ISAPREs and the contracting of benefit plans that do not have restrictions on coverage due to2pre-existing conditions, sex and age, causes known collectively as deficiencies1 and exclusions2. Understanding this, it is possible to point out that the Law specifically seeks to end captivity in the ISAPRE scheme, since the same DFL No. 1 explicitly defines the "captive contributor" as one "whose will is seriously affected, for reasons of age, sex or by the occurrence of health history, whether of him or one of his beneficiaries, and that prevents or restricts, significantly or definitively, his possibility of contracting with another Health Insurance Institution." A completely questionable legal norm, since as the Presidential Advisory Commission (CAP) for the study and proposal of a New Legal Framework for the Private Health System pointed out, “this is one of the particularities of the Chilean system, where the law itself admits the potential existence of limitations to choice and access, an issue that must be modified.” Having said that, it is important to highlight that the Law does not establish in any case that the PDL to be presented must end the logic of private health insurance that ISAPREs currently have (sale of benefit plans for premiums adjusted to the individual risk of the contractor), nor, less, that it prevents the existence of restrictions or exclusions of benefits within complementary health plans for reasons other than pre-existing conditions, age and/or sex. Seen in this light, the Law does not establish the obligation to transform the ISAPRE insurance scheme into a social security scheme, nor does it establish the obligation to generate a single health plan (also known as “standard”, “guaranteed” or “universal”), nor to incorporate flat rates for the contract, nor to establish risk compensation mechanisms between ISAPREs, making it, therefore, a political decision to take any of these options and not a legal obligation. Strictly speaking, only mechanisms that facilitate mobility between ISAPREs with free affiliation to new plans must be ensured, and that these do not have coverage limitations based on age, sex or pre-existing diseases. Thus, the same law leaves open the possibility that there may be different plans with different prices, depending on the benefits offered to members and provider networks.1 DFL No. 1 defines this in letter g) of article 189: “Restrictions on coverage. They may only refer to declared pre-existing illnesses, for a maximum period of eighteen months, counted from the signing of the contract, and will have the limitation established in the first paragraph of article 190." This is known as a deficiency.2 DFL No. 1 defines this in numeral 6 of article 190, which determines the exclusions from coverage: “Pre-existing illnesses or health conditions not declared, unless just cause for error is proven.”3It should also be noted that the PDL to be submitted must not affect the mandate established in the first paragraph of the tenth transitory article:“Within the legislative period of the National Congress corresponding to the year 2024, the President of the Republic must send to the National Congress one or more bills aimed at reforming the health system as a whole, in order to deepen the principles of social security in health and strengthen the powers of the National Health Fund and the Health Superintendency. This is made explicit by the same short ISAPRE Law, at the beginning of the second paragraph of the same article, with the phrase “Without prejudice to the foregoing”. That is to say, the PDL aimed at ending pre-existing conditions and discrimination based on age and sex for membership and benefits in the plans cannot go against or harm the bill(s) aimed at “reforming the health system as a whole, in order to deepen the principles of social security in health”. This has practical political sense, since it allows the presentation of a PDL to end pre-existing conditions and discrimination that specifically resolves the problem of captivity, leaving for later the presentation of a series of coherent Bills, leading to the structural reform of health mandated by the Law, avoiding them coming into conflict.c. The legal obligation responds to a real need to solve a health problem in the private health subsystem: according to the information provided by the Health Superintendency to the Senate of the Republic in 20223, around 837 thousand people were captive due to some type of illness and/or age, which corresponds to 42.5% of ISAPRE contributors in that year, a figure similar to that reported a decade earlier by the CAP. This generates captive people, whether active or passive captivity, must remain in an ISAPRE that also tries to get rid of them through systematic increases in the price of the plans given the greater risk they present, which progressively leads to lower coverage, higher co-payments, and finally, to the "skimming" of people with the highest risk and accident rate to FONASA. In 2014, the CAP reported that captivity does not allow the insurance market to operate well, since "the choice of plan made by individuals is not optimal" due to the lack of adequate competition. Thus, it can be argued that, if there were mobility with better information regarding the coverage and3 Ord SS/N° 2686 of September 26, 2022 "Report on captivity in the Isapres system".4prices of each plan, better levels of competition would be generated, which could benefit members.d. Regulatory alternatives raised in the public debate for the PDL and their implications.i. Minimum project that ends captivity in ISAPRE: in line with the Government program, this would only eliminate restrictions on membership and the possibility of excluding benefits from the plans, due to pre-existing conditions, sex, and age. It would seek to generate financial stability in insurance, replacing risk discrimination mechanisms with adjustments to the plan price based on the risk and claims of the portfolio (free pricing). This type of minimum project would allow for a process that does not affect the perspective of health system reform proposed in the government program (Universal Health Fund) and which must be initiated in the Bills committed to the 2024 legislative period. It should be noted that this perspective is consistent with the PDL presented by Deputies of ruling parties in 20184, headed by the current President of the Honorable Chamber of Deputies, HD Karol Cariola, and the current President of the Senate Health Commission, Senator Juan Luis Castro, which established the end of pre-existing conditions and discrimination based on age and sex (Bulletin 11572-11)5, without the need to establish a single plan, flat rate or an inter-ISAPR risk compensation fund.ii. Project to transform ISAPREs into social health insurance: this directly contradicts the Government's program, moving us away from the horizon of the Universal Health Fund, since this type of PDL would establish a single health plan with a flat rate in the ISAPREs, create an inter-ISAPRE risk compensation fund and regulate complementary insurance in the private sector. Thus, the current ISAPRE scheme would be transformed into social health insurance, generating two parallel social health security schemes that would compete with each other (a form of organization that does not exist in any country in the world). In this case, the new ISAPREs would compete with FONASA for the highest-income and lowest-risk members (sections C and D), perpetuating the income segmentation of the health system. There would thus be one social security health system for the rich, and another for the rest of the population. This type of arrangement in ISAPRE, by transferring to insurers from the inter-ISAPRE fund adjusted for the risk of the portfolio, would encourage them to have more affiliates, changing the current logic in which they seek to have small portfolios of people with low risk and expense. Therefore, if implemented, it is possible to project a growth of insurers and the entry of new business groups. It should be noted that this type of Project is consistent with the "Guaranteed Health Plan in ISAPRE" (Bulletin No. 8105-11)6 presented by former President Sebastián Piñera in his first term, the "Universal Health Plan in ISAPRE" announced in his second term7, and the report of experts cited by the Senate Health Commission, chaired by Sebastián Piñera's former Minister, Emilio Santelices. Political considerations to comply with the established legal obligation: it is considered necessary to emphasize four conditions that the Executive's proposal should meet: i. The proposal must be consistent with the government program: keeping the possibility open, and ideally moving forward with a future bill that establishes the Universal Health Fund (FUS), a strategic and programmatic horizon in the medium term. In this sense, a PDL that puts this path at risk should be avoided, such as one that seeks to transform the ISAPREs into social insurance.ii. It should be of broad consensus within the forces of the official coalition: Taking into consideration the correlation of forces in the current National Congress, the proposal presented by the Executive should be of broad consensus within the Government parties, avoiding a political conflict during the process between official forces and the Government.iii. The debate and action of the Executive should not focus again on the continuity of the ISAPREs: for this reason, an end should be made to the captivity without major political conflict in order to enter into the discussion on strengthening the public sector and resolving waiting lists.6 In the second constitutional procedure: https://tramitacion.senado.cl/appsenado/templates/tramitacion/index.php?boletin_ini=8105-117 More details at: https://prensa.presidencia.cl/comunicado.aspx?id=943816iv. It must be avoided that the segmentation into two subsystems is perpetuated during the processing in the National Congress: given the current correlation of forces, if the PDL presented by the Executive contains in its core ideas elements that could potentially transform the ISAPREs into social health insurance (single plan with flat rate, complementary insurance in ISAPREs and some inter-ISAPRE risk compensation mechanism), the right-wing parliamentarians can introduce amendments to make this happen, exerting political and media pressure so that they are sponsored by the Executive and approved during this Government. As a way to avoid this, we believe that the core idea of the PDL should not contain such elements, which would allow the Executive to control the processing, since article No. 65 of the Political Constitution of the Republic, in its number 6, determines that the President of the Republic has the exclusive initiative to "Establish or modify the norms on social security or that affect it, both in the public sector and the private sector." It must consider the impact on the Presidential campaign and the viability of existing reform paths: We take the precaution that, given the existing legislative times, the dispersion of political forces in the Honorable Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, and the proximity to the end of the third year of Government, it is essential not only to consider the feasibility of pre-existing PDL and successive reform paths being approved by the current Congress, but also, given the high probability that the processing of said projects will be projected for a future legislative period, with the presidential and congressional campaign in between, what is presented must reflect the strategic and programmatic agreements of the government coalition. The presentation of a PDL that transforms ISAPREs into social insurance, similar to the Project that establishes a Guaranteed Health Plan sent to Congress by former President Piñera, risks that the debate in the 2026 presidential campaign will focus on this alternative, and that, in the event of the right-wing candidacy winning, it will become the definitive reform of the health sector. On the contrary, a minimum PDL that ends captivity and allows the presentation of successive projects that seek to establish or gradually transition to the FUS, would allow this alternative to be strengthened during the presidential campaign and make it viable in the medium term.7f. A minimum bill appears to be the only reasonable option to comply with the legal mandate: Taking into account the legal obligation to present the PDL, the specific limits of said obligation, the need to solve a health problem such as captivity, the public policy options reviewed and the political considerations mentioned previously, we propose that the content of the bill should be limited and simple in the mechanisms it proposes to end captivity. In no way should it propose a structural reform to the ISAPRE that would put the political parties of the Government alliance in conflict and that would reduce the relevance in the public discussion of the conflict over the efficiency of the public sector and the resolution of the Waiting Lists. Furthermore, this position would be consistent with the PDL presented by HD Karol Cariola and Senator Juan Luis Castro on the end of pre-existing conditions and discrimination based on age and sex (Bulletin 11572-11)8.2. Elements that we propose to comply with making the system viable together with eliminating pre-existing conditions and the health declaration.a. Legal regulatory elements: The specific content of the bill must eliminate pre-existing conditions such as discrimination based on age and sex, both for affiliation to ISAPREs and for determining restrictions or exclusions of benefits within complementary health plans. In this regard:i. Basic regulatory changes: among these the following must be considered:1. Repeal of the existence of pre-existing conditions and health declaration.2. Elimination of deficiencies (article 189 letter G of DFL No. 1)9.3. Elimination of exclusions due to pre-existing conditions (article 190 of DFL No. 1).4. Eliminate the definition of “captive contributor” (article 170 of DFL No. 1). 5. Eliminate the table of risk factors. 8 In the first constitutional procedure, currently in the Health Commission of the Honorable Chamber of Deputies. The details of the text can be reviewed at: https://www.camara.cl/legislacion/ProyectosDeLey/tramitacion.aspx?prmID=12090&prmBOLETIN=11572-11 9 “g) Restrictions on coverage. They may only refer to declared pre-existing diseases, for a maximum period of eighteen months, counted from the signing of the contract, and will have the limitation established in the first paragraph of article 190”. 8ii. Application only to new plans: The relationship between beneficiaries and ISAPREs is based on a health contract, regulated by DFL No. 1 of 2005. It is an open-ended contract that can only be terminated by mutual agreement, or for reasons specifically stated in the law. Since Article 19 No. 24 of the Political Constitution of the Republic guarantees all persons the right to property in its various forms, over all kinds of tangible and intangible property, these contracts cannot be terminated without the concurrence of both parties. Therefore, in order to normatively make the end of ISAPRE captivity feasible, changes are required in the conditions of the contracts. It is essential that the law contain transitional stipulations for the purposes of gradual adaptation to the new legal provisions. Thus, contracts in force at the time of the enactment of the Law should remain in force until the parties mutually terminate it, while contracts entered into after the enactment of the Law should conform to the new regulations. b. Financial elements: i. Inclusion of health risk in the portfolio as a factor in the ICSA calculation for price increases for plans: by not being able to reject people due to pre-existing conditions, sex or age, or exclude benefits for these reasons, it is expected that ISAPREs will present an increase in the risk of their portfolio and the expenditure on associated benefits. As a way of resolving this, we propose to include in article 198 of DFL No. 1 of 2005 of the Ministry of Health, which regulates the modifications of the base prices of health plans through the ICSA, in its numeral 2 letter a), the regulation that allows the expected changes in the portfolio claims attributable to changes in the risk profile of the affiliates to be incorporated in the calculation of the adjustment. This would allow the adjustment of the rates for the portfolio risk of each ISAPRE, being enabled to “mutualize” (cross-subsidize) the risk in its own pool of beneficiaries without having to resort to compensation funds between ISAPREs.ii. Regulate that mobility between ISAPRE and from FONASA to ISAPRE can be carried out only once a year prior to the calculation of the ICSA: this would make viable the proposed financial balance mechanism, which adjusts the price of the plans (ICSA) based on the risk and claims9 of the portfolio. The restricted mobility period for members would be only between ISAPRE and from FONASA to ISAPRE, given that the private insurance nature of these is understood. This is not the case for mobility from ISAPRE to FONASA, since it is understood that affiliated persons may need to terminate their private contracts for financial reasons, requiring coverage under public insurance, which is supportive and does not discriminate. iii. Improve the regulation of the generation of plans and generate incentives for their convergence: today we know that there are more than 53,148 health plans, with 1,250 on the market10, an issue that evidently generates a suboptimal market where beneficiaries cannot make good decisions given the asymmetry of information. At the same time, as a result of regulations in recent years, the number of plans in force has been declining11. Thus, it is feasible to project that, by eliminating the limitation on plan benefits based on pre-existing conditions, age and sex, the number of plans will be drastically reduced, although at a still suboptimal level. Therefore, it is possible to propose that, by adding other incentives and regulations, the number of plans could be reduced to a reasonable number for beneficiary eligibility. Among these possible regulations, the following stand out:1. Establishing an additional community premium based on portfolio risk: an alternative already proposed by the CAP in 2014 (minority position)12. This consists of dividing the price of the plans within each ISAPRE into the legal health contribution (7% of taxable salary) plus a community premium per beneficiary, set by each ISAPRE, equal for men and women, with no differences based on age or health status of its beneficiaries, which would be determined annually by each ISAPRE based on the ICSA. This is feasible today thanks to the elimination of the excess contributions established by the short ISAPRE Law. This contribution would be the same amount that the contributor would have to contribute for each beneficiary in his family group. Thus, there would be a minimum required contribution to enter each ISAPRE in order to contract10 For more information, review the Working Document of the Studies and Development Department of the Superintendency of Health, “Analysis of the health plans of the ISAPRE system as of January 2024”.11 As an example, in 2016 there were 64,102 current plans, while in 2024 these reached 53,148, with an ever-decreasing trend.12 This proposal was signed by commissioners Fernando Matthews Cádiz, Marcelo Dutilh Labbé, Pedro Barría Gutiérrez and Guillermo Paraje.10 plans, which would operate through cross-subsidies within the portfolio of each insurer (a mechanism called “mutualization” in the public debate), promoting competition between insurers. The minimum premium should be in UF, as are current plans. It should be noted that this proposal is in line with the proposals presented to the Senate Health Committee for the calculation of the debt of insurers during the processing of the Short Law, both the “mutualization” proposal presented by Paula Benavides of Espacio Público; as well as the proposal to replace the calculation of the single factor table with the calculation of the base price of a “Mixed Plan” presented by Álvaro Clarke of the Faculty of Economics and Business of the University of Chile13.2. Maintain the differentiation of the pricing of plans by coverage in preferred provider networks: for this, the community premium could be differentiated by the characteristics of the provider networks and the coverage that each one had, with the possibility of limiting a maximum number of networks to offer in the plans, and with this, the number of plans in each ISAPRE. In 2014, the CAP proposed limiting the number of providers to 3 different networks to offer in each plan, which seems a reasonable number to legislate.iv. The viability of ISAPREs is largely at stake in cost containment mechanisms. As a way to make financially viable the regulation that ends captivity due to pre-existing conditions, deficiencies and discrimination based on age and sex, the following should be considered as a basis: risk-adjusted payments (for example: GRD), and other mechanisms for packaging benefits for new plans, avoiding the fee for service that generates inflation and price distortion. In addition to the necessary reduction of administration and sales expenses.13 The presentations are available on the Senate website: https://tramitacion.senado.cl/appsenado/index.php?mo=comisiones∾=sesiones_celebradas&idcomision=195&tipo=3&legi=485&ano=2023&desde=0&hasta=0&idsesion=19605&idpunto=25566&listado=2113. We also propose to align this project with the approaches of the government program and to advance towards a universal health fund: a. Facilitate and encourage the voluntary transition of ISAPREs to complementary insurance in the Complementary Coverage Modality (MCC) scheme. To do this, consider incentives that make the transition reasonable for insurers, such as maintaining their members: i. Allow the legal continuity of the ISAPRE for the transition to complementary insurance in the MCC. This would imply the closure of the ISAPRE registry and the possibility of a legal continuation of the ISAPRE business to be incorporated as complementary insurance in the MCC. This could be achieved by generating a “change of business” cause for the closure of the registry. ii. Establish the priority participation of the ISAPREs that transit in the MCC tenders carried out by FONASA. iii. Maintain a portfolio of beneficiaries for the ISAPREs that are in transition, with the option for contributors to renounce the MCC and be reassigned to an ISAPRE that is not in transition. iv. Maintenance of coverage in use in the MCC for the beneficiaries of the ISAPREs that are in transition. v. Allow withdrawal of profits for the ISAPREs that have debts with their affiliates as a result of the November 2022 rulings, which become complementary insurance in the MCC. This with an annual review to ensure that the payment of the debt to the beneficiaries is maintained by the Superintendency of Health, withdrawing the authorization in the event that the payment is not made., and the meeting spanned 1 hour, 30 minutes.

    The discussion covered Based on the findings of the Mimedicamento.cl platform, which were presented to the ministerial team last October, the objective of the meeting is to resume the analysis of various proposals to improve people's access to medications whose financial coverage is guaranteed through the different public health policies. TOPICS ADDRESSED AT THE MEETING: CANALAB is a trade association that brings together 18 laboratories, mainly with national capital, with 23 production plants. Its interest is to be permanently collaborating with the health authorities. Through the mimedicamento.cl platform, they make it available to people to find out which medications are guaranteed by both Fonasa and ISAPRES. It is a simple-to-use platform where people enter the medication that was prescribed to them, whether they belong to Fonasa or Isapre, and it gives them information on whether the medication is guaranteed. They have had more than 97,000 visits. In addition, they are invited to answer a survey. Nearly 12,420 responses have been received and the results have shown that 74% have not been able to exercise their right to purchase their medication under the guarantee because they did not know that the medicine was covered and had to buy it. 10% say that it is difficult to make use of the benefit. Based on the results, CANALAB makes the following proposals: 1. Streamline administrative processes to activate the GES, LRS and MLE 2. Strengthen information to facilitate patient access to their medications 3. Increase the availability of medications in the public system and at dispensing points and make them visible. The Ministry would like to thank you for sharing the information, which is undoubtedly very useful for our portfolio. We therefore ask that you send a detailed report with the results of the survey that was conducted in order to analyze the information provided and see how we can make progress in improving the use of the guarantees by the population., and the meeting spanned 0 hours, 30 minutes.

    The discussion covered Presentation of FEMSA Salud Chile (Farmacias Cruz Verde), and of projects and initiatives of pharmacies as health centers and contributions with an impact on public health policies.TOPICS ADDRESSED IN THE MEETING:FEMSA Salud, Mexican multinational with operations in Mexico, Ecuador, Colombia and since 2015 in Chile. Currently it is the representative of Farmacias Cruz Verde, Maicao and Socofar, which has now changed its name to FEMSA. Their interest is to inform the Ministry of the projects they are working on with a view to seeing that they can be a contribution to public policies related to medicines that this or the authorities carry out. According to the studies that have been carried out with the medicines sold in these pharmacies, the result was that the problem of expensive medicines is exclusively in those of PRESCRIPTION and BRAND, which correspond to 80% of the expense, the laboratories take 53% of the value paid and the pharmacies have a higher income with the sale of similar ones than the originals, there being no economic incentives to sell the more expensive medicines. Also, they point out that according to the National Economic Prosecutor's Office, prescription and brand name medicines are expensive because laboratories set the demand through doctors. It is in the interest of Cruz Verde pharmacies to be recognized as a health center, which is why they are carrying out several projects that respond to this objective, among which the following stand out: 1. Implementation of mobile pharmacies in the north and south of the country, to reach localities that do not have access to medicines. 2. Through a medication card, they seek to provide information to people regarding their purchases made in the stores of the pharmaceutical chain. 3. Personalized Pharmaceutical Advice through remote channels, which allows the patient to access advice on their medications and pathologies 365 days a year. 4. Enabling a private box within pharmacies that allows a doctor, remotely, to provide care to patients, perform physical examinations, monitor, diagnose and prescribe to patients. Complete care is assisted in person by a nursing technician. 5. Container pharmacy project, to reach places with pharmacies that due to catastrophes or for seasonal reasons, require it (Fiesta la Tirana, Fiesta la Pampilla, Farellones, etc.) From the Ministry, we appreciate the presentation and request that it be sent to the email of the head of the department. The projects will be evaluated and you will be invited to participate in developing a proposal that provides a solution to the communes of the national territory that do not yet have pharmacies., and the meeting spanned 0 hours, 30 minutes.

At this point, any person who has a health condition (whatever the type), which affects performance, has a disability. The technical and administrative process for disability evaluation corresponds to COMPIN. Given the delay in response times for disability certification, it is suggested that you: 1.

Sincerely, Meeting development: Ms. Paola Zapata explained the difficulties experienced by users with permanent signs and symptoms due to covid and / or the immunization process. Experiences of users and family members are recounted, expressing their discomfort and dissatisfaction with the demands and questions without responses to other public organizations. On behalf of the DCN, Dr. Belgica reports on the status of medical licenses of some associates of the foundation, suggestions and recommendations are provided. Likewise, it is stated that a large part of the users' situation is pending a response from SUSESO, awaiting recognition of the work-related nature of the medical licenses. On the other hand, the foundation expresses its disagreement with the eventual evaluation and ruling of permanent disability, given that a large part of the users still receive curative-type benefits and have not reached their therapeutic plateau, not meeting the criteria to proceed with the evaluation of permanent disability according to Law 16,744. The attendees are informed that in order to carry out this process, the licenses must be of a work-related nature and derived from their respective OAL, a situation that is contrary to the previous paragraph. Guidance is given regarding the process of unrecoverable health of public officials and certification of disability. A request is made to continue with the collaboration between the parties and future meetings. As soon as I can inform,, and the meeting spanned 1 hour, 30 minutes.

    The meeting was conducted at Be assisted remotely by Mr. Collao. in a videoconference format.

    The discussion covered Public procurement modelTOPICS ADDRESSED IN THE MEETING:Representatives of Laboratorio Chile request a lobby meeting in order to raise two issues. The first has to do with local drug production capacities, in which the international trend is to bring production capacities back to the national territory and that the production of pharmaceutical products in lower-cost locations is declining, especially after the pandemic, and even more so with current geopolitical risks, which is why the state should encourage foreign pharmaceutical investment in Chile for the manufacture of pharmaceutical products in the national territory. The trend in Chile in recent years is that national pharmaceutical plants have been closing, due to global commercial decisions and because the state has not been active in attracting pharmaceutical investment. In the last 10 years there has been no growth in pharmaceutical matters unlike in other countries in the region. This could be due to the fact that on the one hand the ISP does not perform audits of foreign pharmaceutical plants that market their pharmaceutical products in Chile, as indicated by DS N°3/2010, unlike national ones, generating unfair competition. According to the data requested by transparencies, in the same period of time, of the foreign plants that export to Chile, which correspond to 1869, only 7 plants have been audited. Instead, approximately 544 audits have been carried out on the 27 pharmaceutical plants in Chile. According to what ISP reported to Lab. Chile, it would not audit foreign plants due to lack of resources, and although there is a fee for this, as the funds go to a common fund and do not return to ISP, it is not possible to maintain an inspection program for Pharmaceutical Labs abroad. From the MINSAL it is said that the authorities are aware of the importance of promoting the production of pharmaceutical products at a local level, which is also included in the government program, especially after what was shown by the pandemic and the multicentric outbreak of the Burkholderia bacteria, where the contamination of a plant that was a single supplier in Chile caused serious supply problems for the products involved in the national health network. In this context, different measures are being evaluated, including the promotion of the national manufacture of pharmaceutical products. The second point has to do with the role of public purchases. In some countries there are policies that encourage local production by granting higher scores to nationally manufactured products in public tenders. Public procurement is a mechanism for establishing public policies, as demonstrated by bioequivalence and the increase in the score awarded in tenders to bioequivalent products, which helped push for compliance with this policy. Finally, they state that the government should promote public policies that promote in the country a weighting of local production, especially because national manufacturing is more expensive than in other countries and public tenders help to counteract this phenomenon due to the volume of products involved in each tender. The Ministry reports that this measure, as well as others, are being studied and evaluated for possible implementation in CENABAST tenders., and the meeting spanned 0 hours, 30 minutes.

Through our technology, it is possible to automate the dispensing process and ensure correct distribution, reducing time and costs. In addition, YAPP's solution offers complete traceability, allowing the Ministry to know in real time when, where and at what time the products are dispensed. This information would be available online for more efficient control of the program. We would be happy to schedule a meeting to show you more details of how YAPP can help in this initiative. I appreciate your attention and I await your response. Topics discussed: Presents the idea of distribution of food products (PP.AA) in independent pharmacies. - Investment pilot, logistics outsourcing of delivery of PNAC products, distribution and traceability. - You must submit information with a letter addressed to the Undersecretary of Public Health with a project and we must visualize the relevance and possibility of generating a collaboration agreement for the pilot., and the meeting spanned 0 hours, 30 minutes.

OBJECTIVE: Respond to the Lobby Law requirement regarding the delay in the transfer of resources from the PESPIIII program. DEVELOPMENTApproach- The meeting begins and a brief presentation of the participants is made.- Data from the participants is requested.- Raimundo Nahuel, president of the Peñalolén association, introduces himself and states that this meeting is being processed on behalf of three organizations.- The reason for this request is that there are 4 communes in the eastern sector where the PESPI program is being developed.- Although this program has been operating for some years and has been gradually consolidated, last year (2023) we had problems with the resources due to the late transfer of resources, a situation that will occur again during 2024.- Although the resources were not transferred, the actions have been carried out and now the resources do not exist. Answers:- The national situation is explained regarding what was experienced as a service in the transfer of resources, apologies are made for what this situation means for the organizations.- Commitments are made to increase resource governance, a request is made to have greater control of this situation and to seek a good term to resolve this situation for the coming years.- The communities request an extension of the deadlines and to monitor compliance with the commitments made due to the delay in the transfers.- This request will be sent to the health service and a meeting will be requested with the organizations in charge of the health service, to accompany the process of closing the budget execution. Since they are the ones who autonomously establish the agreements with the organization in charge of implementing the program.- It is clarified that in November there is another transfer of resources to the health service. In addition, the legal requirements for the rendering of expenses and contracting of services are clarified.IV. AGREEMENTS- Send minutes to the health service- Carry out advocacy on the relevance of the resources- Send minutes to those in charge of the MINSAL budget., and the meeting spanned 1 hours, 0 minutes.
